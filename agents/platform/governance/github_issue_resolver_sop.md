# Platform Agent SOP - GitHub Issue Resolver

> [!CAUTION]
> **INVIOLABLE SAFETY RED LINE:** NEVER inspect, comment on, edit, close, or modify any issue labeled `status:escalation-needed` or `agent:ignore`. Issues labeled `status:escalation-needed` are locked for human intervention and must NEVER be modified or closed autonomously. When querying issues with `gh issue list`, you MUST ALWAYS include `--search "is:issue is:open -label:status:in-progress -label:status:escalation-needed -label:agent:ignore"`.

This procedure outlines the steps for the Platform Agent to autonomously detect the repository target, poll, triage, investigate, and directly resolve open issues from the GitHub issue tracker.

## Procedure

1. **Verify Authentication & Target Repository Context**:
   - Read the target Git repository URL from `/opt/data/SETTINGS.md` (injected by the K8s operator from `spec.integration.gitHub.gitRepo` as `- **Git Repo:** https://github.com/owner/repository.git`).
   - Extract the `owner/repo` string and export it as `GH_REPO`:
     ```bash
     export GH_REPO=$(grep -i "Git Repo:" /opt/data/SETTINGS.md | awk '{print $NF}' | sed -E 's|https://github.com/||; s|\.git$||')
     ```
   - Verify that the GitHub CLI (`gh`) is authenticated and can access the target repository:
     ```bash
     gh auth status
     gh repo view "$GH_REPO" --json nameWithOwner
     ```
   - If unauthenticated or if `GH_REPO` is missing/None, log an error in `memory/` and abort the routine.

2. **Poll Unaddressed Open Issues & Recover Stale Investigations**:
   - First, perform a **2-Hour Stale In-Progress Sweep**: query open issues labeled `status:in-progress` that have not been updated in over 2 hours:
     ```bash
     gh issue list -R "$GH_REPO" --label "status:in-progress" --json number,updatedAt
     ```
     If an issue's `updatedAt` timestamp is older than 2 hours, remove the label so the issue can be retried or escalated:
     ```bash
     gh issue edit <number> -R "$GH_REPO" --remove-label "status:in-progress"
     gh issue comment <number> -R "$GH_REPO" --body "⚠️ **Investigation Timed Out:** The previous automated investigation exceeded the 2-hour threshold without resolution. Removing \`status:in-progress\` for re-triage."
     ```
   - Query up to 5 oldest open issues in `$GH_REPO` using server-side search to exclude active custom status labels (`status:in-progress`, `status:escalation-needed`, or `agent:ignore`):
     ```bash
     gh issue list -R "$GH_REPO" --search "is:issue is:open -label:status:in-progress -label:status:escalation-needed -label:agent:ignore" --limit 5 --json number,title,body,labels,assignees,comments,updatedAt
     ```
   - If no actionable unaddressed issues exist, terminate the routine cleanly by responding with exactly `[SILENT]` (nothing else). Do not generate escalation notices or chat reports for issues that already have `status:escalation-needed` applied.

3. **Multi-Issue Batch Processing Loop & State Locking**:
   - Iterate sequentially through **EACH actionable unaddressed issue `#<number>`** returned by Step 2 in a batch loop. Do NOT stop after the first issue.
   - For each issue `#<number>` in the batch, immediately apply `status:in-progress` lock and assign `@me`:
     ```bash
     gh label create "status:in-progress" -R "$GH_REPO" --color "FBCA04" --description "Work in progress by AI Agent" 2>/dev/null || true
     gh issue edit <number> -R "$GH_REPO" --add-label "status:in-progress" --add-assignee "@me"
     ```
   - **MANDATORY WORKLOG TRACKING RULE:** You MUST log all triage findings, diagnostic steps, and updates within each GitHub issue's comments (`gh issue comment <number> -R "$GH_REPO" --body "..."`) BEFORE reporting back in chat! The GitHub issue comment thread is the source of truth for full tracking of the worklog.
   - Post the initial triage acknowledgment and audit log comment:
     ```bash
     gh issue comment <number> -R "$GH_REPO" --body "🤖 **Platform Agent Triaging:** Issue marked \`status:in-progress\`. Beginning root cause investigation and recording worklog..."
     ```

4. **Triage & Direct Resolution by Platform Agent**:
   - Analyze the issue title, body, and labels to diagnose the root cause directly using GKE read-only tools and local Git repository inspection.
   - **Case A: Code / Manifest Correction Required**:
     - Inspect relevant manifests or scripts directly using workspace tools or by navigating to the local Git repository clone (`./repo/`).
     - Create a local branch (`fix/issue-<number>`), apply the necessary manifest correction or code fix, and commit:
       ```bash
       git checkout -b fix/issue-<number>
       git add <modified-files>
       git commit -m "fix: resolve issue #<number> - <short description>"
       ```
     - Propose the change through the active declarative workflow via Pull Request (e.g., invoking the **`submit-suggestion`** skill or using `gh pr create` linking `Closes #<number>`).
   - **Case B: Cluster Health / Operational Inspection**:
     - Perform direct cluster inspection (`kubectl get`, log queries, telemetry checks). If an operational adjustment or ConfigMap/ResourceQuota fix is required, propose it declaratively via PR.

5. **Evaluate Findings & Transition State**:
   - Once investigation or repair proposals are complete, evaluate the outcome and update the GitHub issue accordingly:
     - **Case 1: Fix Available / PR Created / Issue Resolved**
       - **MANDATORY RAW CLI PROOF RULE:** Your closing comment MUST include a raw markdown code block (` ```text ... ``` `) containing BOTH the exact terminal command executed (prefixed with `$ `) AND the exact raw stdout output proving the fix or rollout verification. Do not only summarize in prose.
       - Post a comprehensive closing comment with **verifiable command + raw stdout proof**:
         ```bash
         gh issue comment <number> -R "$GH_REPO" --body "🤖 **Issue Resolved:** A correction has been implemented and verified.

         ### Verification Proof & Findings:
         - **Diagnosis:** <detailed root cause>
         - **Resolution:** <what was changed / PR #<pr-num>>
         - **Ground Truth Command & Output Proof:**
         \`\`\`text
         $ <EXACT COMMAND EXECUTED, e.g. kubectl get pods -n ...>
         <PASTE EXACT RAW STDOUT / DIFF OUTPUT HERE>
         \`\`\`"
         ```
       - Apply custom status label `status:resolved`, remove `status:in-progress`, and close the issue:
         ```bash
         gh label create "status:resolved" -R "$GH_REPO" --color "0E8A16" 2>/dev/null || true
         gh issue edit <number> -R "$GH_REPO" --add-label "status:resolved" --remove-label "status:in-progress"
         gh issue close <number> -R "$GH_REPO" --reason "completed"
         ```
     - **Case 2: No Change Needed / False Alarm / Irrelevant**
       - **MANDATORY RAW CLI PROOF RULE:** Your closing comment MUST include a raw markdown code block (` ```text ... ``` `) containing BOTH the exact diagnostic command executed (prefixed with `$ `) AND the exact terminal stdout (e.g. raw `kubectl get pods` output) proving that the cluster or resource is healthy. Never close an issue without pasting both the command and its stdout proof block.
       - Post the closing comment with **explicit command + raw stdout diagnostic proof**:
         ```bash
         gh issue comment <number> -R "$GH_REPO" --body "🤖 **Closing Issue (No Action Required):** Investigation confirmed that no modifications are necessary.

         ### Diagnostic Ground Truth Command & Output Proof:
         \`\`\`text
         $ <EXACT COMMAND EXECUTED, e.g. kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns>
         <PASTE EXACT RAW STDOUT FROM KUBECTL OR DIAGNOSTIC TOOL PROVING HEALTHY STATE>
         \`\`\`"
         ```
       - Remove `status:in-progress` and close the issue (`gh issue close <number> -R "$GH_REPO" --reason "not planned"`).
     - **Case 3: Human Decision or Escalation Required**
       - **IMPORTANT CHAT NOTIFICATION RULE:** When an issue requires escalation or transitions to `status:escalation-needed`, your final output response MUST NOT be `[SILENT]`. Instead, you MUST output a clear, urgent notification summary as your final response so it is delivered to the chat! Your summary report MUST include the direct clickable URL to the issue (e.g. `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<number>`) prominently at the top of the message, note that full diagnostic tracking and updates have been recorded in the issue comments, AND explicitly note that adding the label `agent:ignore` to the issue will permanently remove it from being monitored by automated agents.
       - If the ticket requires destructive cluster mutations, missing permissions, or architectural decisions beyond agent red lines, apply custom status label `status:escalation-needed` to flag it for human review and exclude it from further automated polling:
         ```bash
         gh label create "status:escalation-needed" -R "$GH_REPO" --color "B60205" 2>/dev/null || true
         gh issue edit <number> -R "$GH_REPO" --add-label "status:escalation-needed" --remove-label "status:in-progress"
         gh issue comment <number> -R "$GH_REPO" --body "🚨 **Escalation Needed (Worklog Recorded):** Investigation complete. Human intervention required before applying changes... <details>"
         ```

6. **Log to Memory**:
   - Record the issue triage and final state transition in the daily memory log (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`).
