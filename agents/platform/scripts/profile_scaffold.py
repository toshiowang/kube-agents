# profile_scaffold.py - Shared helper to create + overlay a Hermes profile from a baked template.
#
# Used at two points:
#   - Container startup (deploy/shared/docker-entrypoint.sh) scaffolds the static
#     `platform` specialist profile from /opt/platform-template.
#   - Runtime (cluster_agent_profile.py) scaffolds per-cluster profiles from
#     /opt/cluster-template.
#
# Personas are separated by profile identity, persona (SOUL.md), and scoped
# toolset (config.yaml) — all shipped in the template and overlaid here onto the
# profile home under $HERMES_HOME/profiles/<name>. Executable scripts are NOT
# part of a template: they live in the shared /opt/data/scripts and are reachable
# by every profile.

# The only `platforms` keys a named profile inherits from the root config.
#
# Why anything is inherited at all: a cron tick on a named profile runs as a
# `hermes cron tick` *subprocess* with HERMES_HOME pointed at that profile, and
# a subprocess has no live gateway adapters. `cron/scheduler.py`'s delivery
# therefore falls back to `config.platforms.get(<platform>)` read from the
# PROFILE's config.yaml. No template ships a `platforms` block, so that lookup
# finds nothing and every job with `deliver != local` records
# "platform '<name>' not configured/enabled" and posts nowhere.
#
# Why `enabled` alone. It is sufficient: the delivery target does not come from
# this file. It arrives as `GOOGLE_CHAT_HOME_CHANNEL`, which
# `profile_cron_tick.home_target_env` re-reads from the root config and
# re-injects on every spawn — measured, a config `home_channel` with that env
# unset still resolves to "no delivery target resolved for deliver=all", and
# with it set the env value wins. Copying `home_channel` here would duplicate
# routing state that is already carried correctly, and strand a stale channel
# on disk the first time somebody runs `/sethome`.
#
# It is also the most this may safely copy. The operator deliberately keeps
# `platforms` out of per-profile overlays, because an inbound subscription on a
# named profile is a subscription nothing reads — see
# `gatewayScopedPluginConfigSubtrees` in `platformagent_manifests.go`. A boolean
# recording that the platform exists on this install is not a subscription, and
# the credentials and subscription keys stay where they were.

    `cron/jobs.json` is two things in one file. The job definitions —
    schedule, prompt, skills, `enabled` — are image-owned, and an upgrade has
    to be able to change them; that is the whole reason the entrypoint force-
    syncs this directory. But the same file is where the scheduler records
    runtime state (`last_run` and friends), and where an operator's own jobs
    live. A straight copytree took all three, on every pod restart: a job
    added through the operator vanished, and every run's history went with
    it. Losing `last_run_at` is the sharp edge — for a one-shot that field
    *is* the already-ran guard (`_recoverable_oneshot_run_at` returns None
    once it is set), so erasing it makes the job eligible all over again and
    it runs a second time. Recurring jobs fail the other way: a wiped
    `next_run_at` is recomputed from *now*, always landing on a future
    occurrence, which throws away the stale past timestamp the scheduler's
    catch-up window needs. A merely-late daily audit is then skipped rather
    than caught up.

    The rule is per key, which needs no list of "state" fields to keep in step
    with Hermes: **the image wins every key it ships, and every key it does not
    ship is left as the volume had it.** `enabled: false` in the image
    therefore disables a job (the documented way to turn a watchdog off), while
    `last_run`, which no shipped entry carries, survives. Jobs on the volume
    with no counterpart in the image are kept as they are.

    That last rule is also the limit: nothing here can tell an operator's own
    job from one this release deleted, so *removing* an entry from the shipped
    roster does not stop it firing on a cluster that already has it — it only
    ends the image's ability to hold it off. Retire a watchdog by shipping
    `enabled: false` and leaving the entry in place; an id is safe to drop from
    the roster only once every live cluster has merged that disabled form,
    because from then on the volume's copy stays off on its own. The five
    unrunnable watchdogs were retired that way before being deleted here.

    `only_ids` narrows the image side to the ids it names; every other shipped
    job is treated as if the image did not carry it, so the volume's copy — or
    its deliberate absence — stands. The default profile needs that, because
    two of the jobs it ships **delete themselves**: `bootstrap_delivery.py`
    calls `remove_job` on the onboarding pair once the report is delivered.
    Merging that roster unfiltered would resurrect both on the next pod
    restart, and they would then poll once a minute forever, no-op on the
    `.bootstrap_completed` marker, and record a scheduler execution every time.
    Naming the ids keeps the force-merge to the entries whose definition the
    image genuinely owns; the platform profile passes nothing here and merges
    its whole roster as before.
