"""Dispatcher for the ``github-repo-watcher`` cron job.

Polling GitHub is deterministic. Deciding what to do about what the poll found
is not. This script is the first half, and it exists so the second half stops
running when there is nothing to decide.

``github-issue-resolver`` used to be a *prompt* job on this roster at ``*/30``:
every half hour the scheduler started a real agent turn, which loaded the
persona and the skill's ``SKILL.md``, ran ``resolver.py poll``, read
``NO_ISSUES``, and answered ``[SILENT]``. Forty-eight turns a day, and on a
quiet repository every one of them paid for the context before the first API
call. The work the model did was to notice there was no work.

So the poll runs here instead — a ``no_agent`` script, a plain subprocess with
no model attached — and the model is woken only for a repository that actually
has something waiting, by filing a kanban card assigned to ``platform``. An
idle tick costs a handful of ``gh`` calls — a few more once the pull-request
sweep has open pull requests to read the comments of — and writes nothing at
all. What it does not cost is a model turn, which is the whole point: API
calls are cheap and a turn on an empty repository is not.

Why a card rather than the cron job the watchdogs use
-----------------------------------------------------
``../cron/README.md`` argues, correctly, that a card is not a cron run: the
indirection strips ``skills``, ``model`` and ``deliver`` from the thing that
ends up running, which is why the seven governance audits were moved back onto
this roster. That argument is about jobs that fire unconditionally and whose
entire product *is* the cron delivery. A poller is the inverse. It has nothing
to deliver on almost every tick; its product goes to GitHub, not to chat; and a
card appears only in the rare case where there is genuine work. What it gives
up it can afford — the card body names the skill, and ``model``/``max_turns``
take their defaults — and the one thing it must not give up, an audible
failure, stays here: this job keeps ``deliver: "all"``, and anything printed to
stdout below is a fault report that reaches the room.

One watcher, several sweeps
---------------------------
Two cron jobs polling one repository through one credential is one cron job.
Sweeps are registered in ``SWEEPS`` and each runs inside its own ``try``, so a
sweep that raises cannot take its siblings down with it — the isolation that
separate jobs would have given for free, and the reason the ``except`` below is
deliberately broad.

Each sweep owns its own repo resolution and ``gh`` preflight rather than
inheriting one from here. That is not an oversight: ``resolver.py poll``
already does both and already reports precise reason codes
(``GH_CLI_NOT_FOUND`` vs ``GITHUB_AUTH_NOT_CONFIGURED`` vs ``REPO_UNREACHABLE``)
that a hoisted preflight here could only flatten or duplicate.

Consolidating did take something away: an operator could previously stop one
poller by disabling its roster entry. ``GITHUB_WATCHER_SWEEPS`` gives that back.
