"""stall_watch.py - post controller stalls that appeared or cleared since the last tick.

A controller that stops making progress without erroring is invisible to
everything else on the roster. ``k8s-event-watcher`` opens a triage card
within seconds of a Warning event whose reason is on its list, but a Gateway
waiting on a TLS Secret that certificate automation will never create emits
only a controller-level ``SYNC`` warning the list never names, and the watcher
never fires. The daily Workload Reliability Audit reads workload templates and
excludes Events, so it cannot see a reconcile that stopped either. Until
someone asks a Cluster Agent to run ``gke-stall-detection``, nothing looks
(#1342, slice 2).

This is a ``no_agent`` entry on the Platform Agent's roster. The tick prompts
no model. Each tick:

1. lists the clusters of the management project and of every project a
   Cluster Agent profile's ``cluster_identity`` names, which is how a project
   ``spec.scope`` brought in reaches the watch; ``RUNNING`` and
   ``RECONCILING`` clusters with a scaffolded Cluster Agent profile are swept
   (a reconciling control plane still answers), any other status is recorded
   as unreadable with the status rather than skipped, and a cluster with no
   profile, one the reconciler pruned for ``spec.scope.exclude.clusters`` or
   ``RECONCILE_EXCLUDE`` or has not yet scaffolded, is left unread: the
   exclusion is the operator keeping a model turn off that cluster, and this
   watch follows the same roster;
2. per cluster, fetches credentials into a per-cluster kubeconfig and lists
   the namespaces that are not system namespaces;
3. per namespace, runs the Cluster Agent's ``stall_report.py --json`` over a
   bounded list of controller kinds;
4. diffs the rows against the ledger the previous tick left, and on a new
   stall episode in a namespace opens one kanban card assigned to that
   cluster's Cluster Agent, telling it to run ``gke-stall-detection`` there
   and record the finding, so a stall the cron found and a stall a user asked
   about produce the same card, the same diagnosis and the same chat thread.
   The card carries a chat subscription row for the home channel, which is
   what makes the gateway notifier post its progress and completion; a new
   object in a namespace whose card is still open is a comment on that card;
   when every object in the namespace has cleared, the card gets a closing
   comment and is completed. At most ``MAX_CARDS_PER_TICK`` cards open per
   tick; the namespaces past that wait for the next one. Chat gets one line
   when a card opens, one when it closes, one when namespaces were held for
   the next tick, and nothing else.

Every ``gcloud``, ``kubectl`` and ``stall_report.py`` call runs in the shell
sandbox through ``sandbox_exec.run``: the agent container carries no kubectl
or gcloud, and the sandbox is where the credential-proxy shims live. The
sandbox login that runs them is ``hermes``, whose rule (``deploy/sandbox/
Dockerfile``) is that it never executes a file under the agent-owned
``/opt/data``. So ``stall_report.py`` is not run from the sandbox's copy: its
source is read here, from the agent image's ``/opt/defaults/scripts``, and
handed to ``python3 -I -`` on the command's stdin. ``-I`` matters as much as
the stdin: the sandbox command runs with ``/opt/data`` as its working
directory, and without isolated mode that directory is first on the module
path, so a ``json.py`` the model dropped there would be the code that ran.
What ``hermes`` executes is the image's code at this commit and the standard
library, the per-cluster kubeconfigs stay in ``hermes``'s own home where the
model cannot reach them, and the sandbox image's copy of the script being
older than the agent image's stops mattering. Nothing here mutates a cluster.

Why a bounded kind list. ``stall_report.py`` defaults to every namespaced kind
the API server knows, one ``kubectl get`` each, which is right for one
namespace a user asked about and wrong for a fleet sweep every half hour.
``DEFAULT_KINDS`` names the controllers whose stalls this watch exists for.
``STALL_WATCH_KINDS`` replaces it for a run started by hand in the pod, and
``all`` restores the script's default; the operator's env allowlist does not
carry it yet, so an install cannot set it through the CR. Pods are left out
on purpose: a Pod that cannot start raises the Warning reasons the event
watcher is gated on, and its owner shows here through its own condition or
reference.

Why a ledger. A stall lasts hours or days, and a watch that filed a card for
it every thirty minutes would be muted within the hour. The ledger holds one
entry per row ``stall_report.py`` emits and one episode per namespace with an
open card: the card opens when a namespace's first row appears and closes
when its last row clears, a new object in the namespace is a comment on the
card, and a row that joins an object already on it (a Deployment that adds
ProgressDeadlineExceeded ten minutes after its dangling reference) is folded
in silently. A ``repeating-warnings`` row exists only while its event
recurred inside the script's window, so a warning that comes back every hour
would otherwise flap in and out; such a row clears only after two
consecutive scans without it. A namespace or cluster this tick could not
read keeps its rows rather than clearing them, because absence of evidence
is not recovery, and so does a row whose own kind a scan skipped, or a
repeating-warnings row when the events were not read (the kind list is
filtered per cluster to what it serves, so such a skip is a failure and never
a missing CRD, and every other row in the namespace is judged as usual); one that is gone from the listing clears
them at once, because deleting the namespace is how the motivating case
usually ends. A listing gcloud itself calls incomplete clears no row for a
cluster absent from it, and a sweep stops at a wall-clock budget short of
the schedule and reports what it did not reach, because Hermes kills a
script that runs an hour and a ledger never written is a tick that never
happened.
