"""The morning nudge: a short chat message naming the top critical findings.

Backs the ``findings-morning-nudge`` cron job, which runs with ``no_agent:
true`` and ``deliver: "chat"``. Its stdout is delivered verbatim, so everything
this prints is what the user reads.

No model turn, because there is no judgement to make: the ordering is the
queue's (`GET /v1/findings/ranked`), the severity is computed by the rubric at
registration, and the recommendation was written by whoever found the thing.
What is left is counting and formatting.

This is §7.2 of `docs/designs/inventory-findings-queue.md` minus its third
line. The design's nudge links to a backlog document holding the whole queue;
that publisher (§7.1) is not built, so the message says how many findings it did
not name rather than pointing at a list of them.
