"""Run a cluster command in the shell sandbox rather than in the agent pod.

The agent image carries no `kubectl`, `gcloud`, `gh` or `git`, in any form: not
the binaries, and not the credential-proxy shims that used to stand in for them.
`deploy/docker/Dockerfile` step 2 removed the first, the note where the symlinks
used to be removed the second, and the guard at the end of the `platform` stage
fails the build if either comes back. Agent-side code with a reason to invoke one
— the platform MCP server, the cluster-agent scripts, `gke_endpoint.py`,
`forge.py`, `resolver.py` — calls `run()` here instead of `subprocess.run`, and
the command executes in the sandbox.

Several of those files run on both sides of the boundary: `resolver.py poll` is a
subprocess of the agent pod's cron gate, while `resolver.py claim` is invoked by
the model from a shell that is already in the sandbox. One call site serves both,
because `sandbox_enabled()` is false in the sandbox — the managed config it reads
is an agent-pod file — and `run()` then executes locally.

A caller with more than one command to run crosses once, with the whole job,
rather than once per command: `resolver.py` and `github_token_refresh.py` both
forward *themselves* through `run()` and do their work on the far side. An ssh
hop costs the same whatever it carries, and a caller that makes a dozen of them
under a timeout is spending the budget on the connection rather than on the
work. Re-entry is not a loop for the same reason one call site serves both
sides: `sandbox_enabled()` is false over there.

Two things about this module are load-bearing and easy to undo by accident.

It connects as `hermes`, not as `terminal.ssh_user`. That setting is the login
Hermes gives the model's shell, and it owns its own home directory in the
sandbox; bash sources `~/.bashrc` even for a non-interactive `ssh host cmd`, so
a caller authenticating as it would run the model's startup file before its own
command and could be handed forged output as a trusted tool result. Debian's
stock non-interactive guard at the top of `.bashrc` hides this, and the model
can delete the guard. `deploy/sandbox/Dockerfile` creates the second account.

It does not build the ssh subprocess environment from `os.environ`. The agent
pod holds `API_SERVER_KEY` and `SESSION_KV_API_KEY`, and `_run_env()` in
`agent_common_server.py` — the helper most of these call sites used to pass —
is `{**os.environ, "HOME": "/tmp"}`. Nothing crosses today, because the
sandbox's `sshd_config` sets `PermitUserEnvironment no` and accepts only `LANG`
and `LC_*` — plus `HERMES_PROFILE_HOME` for the `agent` account alone, which
this module never is — but that is the remote end declining what this end
should not offer.
Variables the remote command genuinely needs go through `remote_env`, which
renders them into the command line rather than into the client's environment.

`remote_env` is therefore for paths and names, never for secrets. A command
line is the process's `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`, which every account in the sandbox
can read — the model's own shell included, and it is the party this boundary
exists to keep away from the agent pod's credentials. Its callers pass
`KUBECONFIG`, a path to a file the sandbox already has. A caller with a secret
to hand across has no route here and should not invent one: the credential
proxy holds credentials so that the sandbox never does.

# line rather than a second credential, and the separation the module docstring
# describes is the only thing keeping them apart.
#
# Three writers pass it, all for the same reason: they have to write inside a
# tree that is `agent:agent` to the leaves, which uid 1001 cannot do.
# `kanban_workspace_gc.py` unlinks scratch workspaces; `cluster_agent_profile.py`
# writes one profile's kubeconfig; `bootstrap_delivery.py` renames the delivered
# onboarding report. The alternative in any case — loosening the modes so a
# shared group could reach in — buys a wider grant than the narrower login does,
# and leaves uid 1001 writing into a tree uid 1000 owns, which is a
# symlink-follow waiting to happen.
#
# What makes it safe there does not generalise: no writer consumes the
# command's output as a fact about the cluster, and a `.bashrc` that hijacked
# one would be doing to uid 1000's own files what uid 1000 can already do. A
# caller that reads a command's output and believes it must use the default.
#
# `read_bytes` is the exception, and it is this module's own default rather than
# an argument any caller passes. It does consume the output — but as the bytes
# of a file uid 1000 wrote, not as a fact about the cluster, and reading them as
# `hermes` would only widen what a model-composed path can reach. Its docstring
# argues the case; the rule above still binds anything that runs a *command* and

    rendered into the remote command line. `local_env` replaces the environment
    of the local fallback for the one caller that has to subtract a variable
    rather than add one — see `_default_runner` in `gke_endpoint.py`, where a
    forwarded `KUBECONFIG` turns a `describe` into a guaranteed HTTP 400. It has
    no remote counterpart because the remote command inherits nothing from here.

    `stdin` is how a document reaches the command without a file. A caller in
    the agent pod that wants `gh` to publish a pull-request body cannot name a
    path: `gh` runs two hops away, in the credential proxy's filesystem, and
    the only thing all three processes share is the byte stream. So the body
    travels as text on fd 0 and the argv says `--body-file -`. ssh forwards fd 0
    to the remote command, and `-T` in `_CONNECT_OPTIONS` keeps it a plain pipe
    rather than a pty that would rewrite the bytes in transit.

    Falls back to running locally when no sandbox is configured. Two different
    situations reach that branch and it is right for both. In the agent pod it
    means the install turned the sandbox off, and the image carries no
    credentialed binary, so the call fails with "command not found" — the honest
    report, and why the fallback is a plain `subprocess.run` rather than an error
    raised here. In the sandbox it is the normal case: `resolver.py` and
    `forge.py` also run there, there is no managed config to read, and local is
    where the command belongs.

    Raises SandboxUnavailable when ssh itself could not connect.

    The output is buffered whole, with no ceiling. `timeout` bounds how long a
    command may run but not how much it may print, so a command that writes
    faster than it runs long — or a shell startup file in the sandbox that
    prints without stopping, since ssh runs the login shell before the command —
    is held in this process's memory until it ends. That is a property of every
    call here rather than of any one caller, and the agent pod trusts the
    sandbox it dialled, so capping it is a hardening change of its own.

    """Up to `max_bytes` bytes of `path` in the sandbox, or None.

    None is "there is nothing at this path". `SandboxReadFailed` is "something
    is there and did not arrive": not a regular file, not readable, a read that
    failed partway, or output that did not survive the trip. `SandboxUnavailable`
    means the sandbox was never reached, which a caller may want to retry.

    Reads at most `max_bytes`, and bounds the transfer as well as the result:
    the cap is applied by `head` on the far side, so a caller asking for 32 KiB
    of a 2 GB core dump moves 32 KiB. Pass one byte more than the real ceiling
    to tell "at the limit" from "over it", the way a local capped read does.

    `principal` defaults to `TERMINAL_PRINCIPAL`, which is NOT this module's
    default and is deliberate. The other callers that name it pass it to
    write inside an `agent`-owned tree; this one passes it to read with no more
    privilege than whoever wrote the file had. Every deliverable in the sandbox
    is written by the model's own shell, which logs in as `terminal.ssh_user` --
    `agent` -- so reading as `hermes` would add no access this needs while
    adding one it must not have: the path reaching this function comes from a
    record the model influences, and `hermes` can open files under /home/hermes
    that `agent` cannot. A symlink is enough to turn a report into a private key,
    and the caller pastes what comes back into a human's chat thread. The
    `hermes` default protects a caller that believes the *output* of a command;
    this one believes only the bytes of a file the model already owns.

    The bytes are moved base64-encoded because the payload is a file rather than
    text: `run` decodes stdout with the locale codec, which silently substitutes
    a replacement character for anything that is not valid UTF-8. A PDF would
    arrive corrupted and no caller could tell.

    The marker line is there because the login shell runs first. A `.bashrc`
    that prints anything -- a banner, a warning from a tool it sources -- puts
    that text in front of the payload, and base64 would decode it as part of the
    file. Everything up to and including the marker is discarded.

    The read lands in a scratch file on the far side before it is encoded,
    rather than being piped straight into `base64`. A pipeline's exit status is
    its last command's, and `base64` exits 0 on the empty input a failed `head`
    hands it -- so an unlinked, replaced or unreadable-after-the-test file came
