#!/usr/bin/env python3
# cluster_agent_profile.py - Manage per-cluster Cluster Agent Hermes profiles.
#
# The Platform Agent runs this from its terminal to dynamically create, delete,
# list, and resolve the name of the Cluster Agent profile for a specific GKE
# cluster, inside its own pod. One profile per managed cluster; it persists until
# the cluster is deleted.
#
# Mechanism (verified against the shipped Hermes CLI):
#   - `hermes profile create <name>` registers an isolated profile and stores its
#     home at $HERMES_HOME/profiles/<name>. Because HERMES_HOME is the data PVC
#     (/opt/data) in the pod, profiles persist across restarts automatically.
#   - We then overlay the baked Cluster Agent template (/opt/cluster-template/:
#     SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, config.yaml, skills/) onto that home, pin a kubeconfig
#     scoped to the target cluster, and write the cluster identity into USER.md.
#   - Delegation runs on the shared kanban board (assignee = the profile name);
#     this script only manages profile lifecycle + name resolution, not dispatch.
