    non-secret loopback sentinel `cluster-internal-trusted`
    (`k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_manifests.go`), on the
    premise that the listener is loopback-only and the envoy sidecar
    authenticates outside callers against `API_SERVER_EXTERNAL_KEY`. Hermes does
    not honour that premise from this side: it prefers `$HERMES_HOME/.env` over
    the process environment (`hermes_cli/auth.py` — "Prefer ~/.hermes/.env over
    os.environ so a deliberate key rotation ... isn't shadowed by a stale shell
    export"), and its Docker stage2 hook writes a freshly generated strong key
    into that file whenever it does not already carry one. The sentinel is
    therefore overridden on every boot, by a value this process never sees, and
    every loopback caller that trusts the environment gets 401.

    Measured on kage-management 2026-08-18: seven consecutive `github-repo-watcher`
    relay turns rejected in one pod's first two hours, each degrading to an
    unrelayed raw report that the scheduler still recorded as delivered. Writing
    the sentinel into `.env` to force agreement is not an alternative — the API
    server then declines to bind at all.

    Read per call rather than cached at import: `.env` is rewritten a few seconds
    *after* this process starts, so an import-time read returns the last boot's

# one failure being reported repeatedly, and this cap is the backstop for the
# case that defeats it — many *distinct* failures at once, typically a node or
# a namespace going down and taking a hundred unrelated pods with it.
#
# Suppression is deliberately invisible in chat. Announcing the ceiling would
# spend a message to say no more messages are coming, which is self-defeating
# when the point is a quieter channel. The trade-off is real and worth naming:
# once the cap bites, a silent channel no longer distinguishes "nothing is
# wrong" from "the budget is spent", so the accounting lives outside chat
# instead. Every suppressed alert is counted per severity in `alert_quota`,
# logged at WARNING with the workload that was dropped, and readable from
# `GET /v1/alert-quota`. Anyone asking "did we miss something today" has an
# answer; they just have to ask.
#
# Severities come from get_severity_details, and every one of them is capped.
# Info is not a hypothetical: nothing between the kubelet and this function
# filters on Event.Type. The watcher's filter matches reason, namespace and
# repeat count only, and its informer runs without a field selector, so an
# allowlisted reason arriving as `type: Normal` is forwarded like any other,
# classified Info here, and — left out of this dict — would post to chat and
# start an agent turn outside every ceiling. `BackOff` is on the watcher's
# default reason list and the kubelet emits it as Normal for image-pull
# back-off, which is exactly the storm the cap exists for.
#
# Covering all three also means the `.get(severity, 0)` default in
# _claim_alert_quota is now reached only by a severity this module cannot
# produce, rather than by a routine one.
#
# Counts are fleet-wide rather than per-cluster, matching the ceiling as
# specified. The trade-off is that one collapsing cluster can exhaust the day's
# budget for the others; `GET /v1/alert-quota` is where that shows up.

    """The kanban card body the front door files for the failing cluster's agent.

    Written to be copied verbatim rather than summarised, because a paraphrase
    is how the front door turned one instruction into three on 2026-08-17.

    The delivery is `kanban_complete` and nothing else. The card carries a
    subscription pointing at the chat thread the alert was posted in — see
    `deploy/docker/patches/kanban_event_routing.py`, which resolves that thread
    from the routing this module records — so the notifier posts the `result`
    when the card turns terminal. That is why this body asks for the whole
    report in `result` rather than a summary of it: `result` is the message the
    human reads.

    The report template below is a second instruction channel alongside the
    persona, and says "formatted exactly like this" — so it wins any
    disagreement with the Platform Agent's SOUL.md §7 (Incident Triage
    Communication Policy), which governs the same output. Keep the two in step:
    §7 permits exactly the three ``##`` sections this template uses, and a
    fourth labelled block added here silently overrides the policy rather than
    extending it. The template states that shape itself rather than citing the
    section, because the reader is a Cluster Agent, whose persona has no §7 —
    the delegation to that persona is what makes the citation unresolvable for
    the agent being asked to obey it.

    The report used to end by inviting the reader to reply ``apply``, and that
    invitation is withheld here until something honours it. The agent that acts
    on such a reply reads the report back from the ``incidents`` table through
    the ``incident_context`` plugin, and the only writer of that table is
    ``platform_mcp_server.send_notification`` — the egress call this delivery
    path replaced. So the row is never written, ``_lookup`` returns ``None``,
    and the front door receives the bare word ``apply`` with no report, no
    options and no cluster. Nothing unsafe happens; the front door holds no
    write path and simply cannot act. It is a promise the system cannot keep,
    and on ``main`` it was never tested because no report reached a human to
    reply to. Storing the report on the delivery path is issue #802; the
    bullet comes back with it. §7 rule 3 — "no offer to help further" — is on the
    side of the removal, which is why the docstring here used to have to argue
    the call-to-action past it.

    The report template below is STANDARD markdown, and must stay that way.
    Every chat platform's adapter translates the agent's markdown on the way
    out; on Slack that is ``SlackAdapter.format_message``, which rewrites
    ``**bold**`` to ``*bold*`` and ``[label](url)`` to ``<url|label>``. Writing
    the template in the destination's own syntax does not skip that pass, it
    feeds it: a pre-authored ``*Issue:*`` matches format_message's single-
    asterisk ITALIC rule and every heading in the delivered report came out
    italic instead of bold. Authoring in markdown also lets the Block Kit
    renderer (``platforms.slack.extra.rich_blocks`` in agents/chat/config.yaml)
    see the structure and emit real header, list and table blocks.
