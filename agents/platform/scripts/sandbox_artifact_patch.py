"""Bring a deliverable into the gateway when the agent wrote it in the sandbox.

Once the shell sandbox is on, the agent's file tools run in
``platform-agent-shell-0`` and write to that pod's own volume. The kanban
notifier does not: ``GatewayKanbanWatchersMixin._deliver_kanban_artifacts``
runs in the gateway, and its first act is to screen every candidate path
through ``os.path.isfile``. In the gateway that call is ``False`` for every
file the agent produced, so ``candidates`` comes back empty and the function
returns before the adapter is involved at all.

Nothing reports that. The path is dropped by the branch whose comment reads
"the path may have been mentioned for reference only", so a completed card that
produced a report delivers no report, no upload error and no notice -- the
thread gets the agent's prose and nothing else. Every artifact type is affected,
not only the text ones: a PDF that would have drawn an "attachment unavailable"
notice now draws silence.

So this stages the file instead. Each declared artifact that exists on the far
side is copied into a temp directory here, and the local path is handed to the
original method, which then behaves exactly as it did before the sandbox: the
``isfile`` screen passes, ``BasePlatformAdapter.filter_local_delivery_paths``
accepts it, and the adapter gets a real file to upload -- or to fail to upload
and report, which on a credential-proxy install is the outcome that matters.

What this does not recover
--------------------------
Only the first of the original's three sources, ``event_payload['artifacts']``.
The other two hand a block of the model's prose to
``BasePlatformAdapter.extract_local_files``, which screens each path it matches
with its own ``os.path.isfile`` before returning it -- so those paths are gone
inside the adapter, before this patch could see them. Recovering them means
reimplementing that method's path regex and its code-span exclusions out here,
against a copy of the extension list, and then owning the drift. The explicit
list is what ``agents/platform/SOUL.md`` tells the agent to use for a
deliverable, and a path recovered from prose is dropped exactly as it is
dropped today.

The same screen is why a path the prose names can still send the wrong file.
On an upgraded install the gateway pod keeps pre-migration copies at the paths
the agent now writes in the sandbox. The wrapper keeps a declared path out of
the list unless the sandbox said it has no such file, but a path in the summary
or ``task.result`` reaches the original through ``extract_local_files``, whose
``isfile`` passes on that copy. Suppressing it would mean relying on the
original's basename dedup between its sources, which is internal to it.

Nor the artifact that never reaches a completion event at all. ``kanban_db.py``
validates the declared list at ``kanban_complete`` time, and for a path *under
the card's managed scratch workspace* it expands, resolves, containment-checks
and ``is_file()``-checks it in the gateway -- which fails under the sandbox and
raises ``ArtifactPreservationError`` at the model rather than returning an
event. That failure is loud, the model sees it, and it happens before anything
here runs. A path outside the managed workspace -- ``/opt/data/INVENTORY.md``,
which is what ``SOUL.md`` tells a worker to declare -- takes the pass-through
branch instead, with no ``is_file()`` check, and is the case this patch fixes.

Nor an install running in strict media-delivery mode. Upstream's validator then
demands the file sit under an allowlisted root or inside a recency window, and
neither test can be evaluated for a path in another pod; staging would launder
the path past a check the operator turned on deliberately. ``_screen`` stages
nothing in that mode and says so in the log.

Why the path is rewritten rather than the file being recreated where the agent
put it
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Writing the bytes back to the same absolute path in this pod would need no
rewriting anywhere and would keep the original path in the notice. It is also a
way to hand the model arbitrary file writes in the credentialed container: the
path arrives in a completion event the model composes, and ``/opt/data`` here
holds ``profiles/<name>/scripts``, which is importable. A staged copy under a
temp directory cannot become code no matter what the model names.

The basename is preserved inside that directory because it is what the reader
sees -- the adapter derives the attachment filename from the path, and a report
delivered as ``tmp8ug1ke`` is a worse bug than the one this fixes.

The notice keeps naming the agent's own path, not the staged one, because the
staged one is deleted before the message is read and describes nothing anyone
can act on. ``google_chat_relay_patch`` and the build-time attachment-notice
patch both ask ``original_path`` below for the translation.
