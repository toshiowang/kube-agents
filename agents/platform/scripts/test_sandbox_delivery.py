"""The sandbox's copy of the shared scripts, against what the agents ask for.

Since #737 the agent's shell runs in a different container, so a SKILL.md line
like `python3 /opt/data/scripts/gitops_workspace.py` resolves in the sandbox
image rather than the agent image. Nothing connects the two: adding a script and
calling it from a skill passes every check in this repository and then fails at
runtime with "No such file or directory", in a pod nobody was looking at.

deploy/sandbox/Dockerfile carries the list, as an allowlist rather than a copy of
the directory — most of agents/platform/scripts/ is agent-pod machinery that
cannot work there. This holds the allowlist to three properties:

  - every shared script an agent is told to run is either on it or deliberately
    stubbed,
  - it is closed under import, so nothing on it fails at its first `import`,
  - nothing on it names an interpreter the sandbox image does not have.
