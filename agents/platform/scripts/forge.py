"""forge.py — the five forge operations this harness needs, behind one seam.

Staged into `$HERMES_HOME/scripts` by the entrypoint's step 2b force-sync, so
every skill script on the Platform Agent's `sys.path` can import it.

What this is for
----------------
Reading and answering a pull-request conversation needs exactly five things from
a code-hosting service: who am I, which pull requests are open, what has been
said on one, say something back, and acknowledge that a request was seen. Those
five are the whole forge-shaped surface of the feature; everything above them —
what counts as addressing the agent, who is allowed to, when a request has
already been answered — is harness policy that does not change between forges.

Splitting the two here is what makes a second forge a new class rather than a
second copy of the sweep. It is *not* a claim that a second forge is cheap:
`docs/designs/pr-comment-conversation.md` §3 lists the four places under this
module — token brokering, the credential sidecar's executable allowlist, git
credential shape, and the CRD — that would each need work first. The seam is
here so that when that work happens it lands in one place.

Why `_call` exists
------------------
Every provider method reaches `gh` through one method. The agent container holds
no GitHub token: `gh` is proxied to the credential sidecar, which is also why
`ALLOWED_EXECUTABLES` is a closed list. Bitbucket has no comparable CLI, so a
Bitbucket provider cannot shell anything at all — it needs a `/v1/<forge>/…`
route on that sidecar. Funnelling every call through one override point means
that provider replaces one method instead of reimplementing five.

Three normalisations, and the forge that forced each
----------------------------------------------------
* **`Comment.can_write` is a boolean, not GitHub's `authorAssociation`.** The
  provider answers "may this account direct the agent?" and the caller never
  sees a forge's vocabulary. GitHub appears to hand the association over free on
  every comment, but it is not usable here: `author_association` is reported
  relative to what the *authenticated viewer* can see, and an App installation
  token cannot see organisation membership. A repository admin's comment comes
  back `CONTRIBUTOR` under this credential — observed live — so trusting the
  field refuses the very people entitled to direct the agent. The provider asks
  `repos/{repo}/collaborators/{user}/permission` instead and caches the answer
  per account for the tick, which is the same members lookup GitLab and
  Bitbucket would need.
* **`supports_acknowledge` is a capability, not an assumption.** Bitbucket Cloud
  has no reactions on pull-request comments. A caller that assumed the 👀 would
  either crash there or silently skip it; a flag makes the absence legible.
* **`normalise_login` strips a trailing `[bot]`.** GitHub's REST and GraphQL
  APIs disagree about whether an App's login carries the suffix — `AGENTS.md`
  records the same discrepancy for `kube-agents-bot`. Comparing an unnormalised
  login against a comment author is how an agent ends up answering itself
  forever. Every login crossing this seam goes through it, including the one
  `viewer_login` reads out of the credential store.

On the repository parser
------------------------
`_parse_repo` is a deliberate copy of `github-issue-resolver`'s
`get_target_repo`, not a reference to it: a shared module must not import from a
skill. Two copies can drift, so `test_forge.py` runs both parsers over one corpus
and fails when they disagree. That test is the thing to delete — along with this
copy — when `resolver.py` migrates onto this module, which
`docs/designs/pr-comment-conversation.md` §7 keeps out of scope for now.

The looser parser in `gitops_workspace.repo_from_settings` is deliberately not
reused. It strips a `github.com/` prefix and otherwise takes the last two path
segments, so `https://evil.com/github.com/attacker/repo` resolves to
`attacker/repo`. That is out of scope here and noted rather than fixed.

        A non-collaborator 404s, and that is a definitive no. Any other failure
        — a proxy fault, a timeout, a 5xx — is not an answer, and collapsing the

        with a public refusal carrying `<!-- agent-refused:… -->`, and that

        network blip would refuse a maintainer permanently, and they would have
        to notice and re-comment. So the unknown gets its own value and the
        caller waits for the next tick.

        `<name>[bot]`, and `[`/`]` are not path characters — unencoded that is a
        malformed URL rather than a 404, so the failure is not "no such
