"""Deterministic (no-LLM) delivery for first-time onboarding.

This script backs the ``bootstrap-inventory-delivery`` cron job, which runs
with ``no_agent: true``. Its stdout is delivered verbatim by the cron
scheduler to the job's configured target (``deliver: origin`` — the chat the
user first spoke in, bound by the ``bootstrap_onboarding`` plugin).

Delivery happens exactly once, and only when discovery has finished AND a
human has connected:

- ``.user_aligned`` present -> a human has opened the chat (set by the plugin;
  never by a background task — see the plugin README).
- ``.bootstrap_completed`` absent -> the report has not been delivered yet.
- ``INVENTORY.md`` present  -> the background scan has produced the report.

The two markers are this pod's, and are checked first. The report is not: the
prioritization worker writes it through its terminal, and with the shell
sandbox on that terminal is the sandbox pod, whose data volume this pod does
not mount. So the report is read over ``sandbox_exec.read_bytes`` when the
sandbox is on, and from ``HERMES_HOME`` when it is off, and only once both
markers say a delivery is due — the ssh read is the one check with a cost.

When all three hold, the script claims delivery, prints ``INVENTORY.md``
(delivered verbatim) and sets the report aside where it was read. Otherwise it
prints nothing, which the ``no_agent`` cron path treats as a silent run (no
message). The first run ``RETIRE_AFTER_SECONDS`` or more after a delivery
removes the two onboarding cron jobs; ``_retire_jobs`` says why the delivering
run cannot.

The claim is what makes "exactly once" true rather than merely likely.
``.bootstrap_completed`` is created with ``O_CREAT | O_EXCL`` *before* anything
reaches stdout, so of two runs racing on the same report — a scheduled tick and
the plugin's ``trigger_job``, say — exactly one can win the create and emit;
the loser exits silently. Checking the marker and then writing it after
delivery would leave both runs inside the same window, and the user would be
sent the entire onboarding report twice.

Because the prioritization stage writes a finished, presentation-ready
``INVENTORY.md``, no LLM is involved in delivery: what that stage produced is
exactly what the user sees. The sweep's complete findings are a different file
(``INVENTORY.raw.md``) and are never delivered from here.
