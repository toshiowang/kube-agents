"""Reconcile the image's cron job declarations into the running agent's job file.

Why this exists
---------------
``docker-entrypoint.sh`` syncs ``/opt/defaults`` onto the PVC with ``cp -ru``,
which copies a file only when the *source* is newer. The Hermes scheduler writes
``last_run`` back into ``$HERMES_HOME/cron/jobs.json`` on every tick, so the PVC
copy is **always** newer than the image's. The force-sync beside it covers
``config.yaml SOUL.md AGENTS.md CAPABILITIES.md`` and not ``cron/``.

The consequence is that a cron job added to ``agents/chat/defaults/cron/jobs.json``
never appears on an existing deployment — only on a fresh PVC. That is the same
class of silent failure the force-sync was introduced to fix, applied to the file
that decides what the agent does unattended.

A blanket ``cp -f`` is not the remedy. It would reset every ``last_run`` (making
every job look due at once), discard the chat binding the ``bootstrap_onboarding``
plugin writes (``deliver: origin`` plus ``origin``), and resurrect the two
onboarding jobs that ``bootstrap_delivery.py:_retire_jobs`` deliberately removes once
onboarding has finished. So this merges by job id instead.

The split
---------
Per key, not per field-list: **the image wins every key it ships, and every key
it does not ship is left as the volume had it.** ``name``, ``schedule``,
``prompt``, ``script``, ``skills``, ``no_agent`` and ``enabled`` are all shipped,
so all of them track the image. The scheduler's own state is not shipped by
anything, so all of it survives — including whatever Hermes starts recording
next, which is the reason for the rule rather than a list. See ``merge_job``.

This is `profile_scaffold.merge_cron_store`'s rule, deliberately: that function
governs the Platform Agent's roster and this one governs the Chat Agent's, and
two rosters obeying opposite merge rules is a trap for whoever edits either.

``enabled`` being image-owned is the load-bearing consequence. Shipping
``enabled: false`` is how a watchdog is turned off fleet-wide, which is the
protocol ``concepts/autonomous-watchdogs.md`` documents and the one the five
retired watchdogs took. The cost is the other direction: a job disabled by hand
on a live pod is switched back on by the next image roll, because the image is
the declaration of record. Retire a job by shipping ``enabled: false`` and
leaving the entry in place; dropping the id is safe only once every live cluster
has merged that disabled form, since nothing here prunes.

``RUNTIME_WINS`` is the single exception, for the one shipped key a runtime hook
owns.

The ledger
----------
A job absent from the runtime file is ambiguous — either it is new in this image,
or it was deliberately removed at runtime (which is exactly what ``_retire_jobs``
does). The ledger records every id this script has installed, which separates the
two: an id in the ledger but missing from the runtime file was removed on purpose
and is never reinstalled.

The ledger cannot help on its *first* run, though, because it starts empty: a
deployment that finished onboarding before this script existed has no record that
the two onboarding jobs were retired, so they would look new and come back. They
would come back inert — both scripts check ``.bootstrap_completed`` and return
silently — until the delivery script's first run retires them again.
``--assume-retired`` closes that: the caller, which is the only thing that knows
*why* a job is gone, seeds those ids into the ledger. The entrypoint passes the onboarding ids when
``.bootstrap_completed`` exists.

Concurrency
-----------
Within one pod there is one writer, and it takes two separate facts to say so.
This runs from the entrypoint ahead of ``exec "$@"``, so the scheduler in that
container has not started; and step 1.5 of the entrypoint hands the shared tree to
a single owning container, so the dashboard — which runs the same image over the
same PVC, and has no scheduler of its own — never reaches the step that calls this.

**Both facts are scoped to one pod, and that is the limit of the guarantee.** Step
1.5 elects an owner per pod, not per volume: the operator sets
``AGENT_SHARED_STATE_SETUP=owner`` on the gateway container of the pod *template*
(``platformagent_manifests.go``), so every replica's gateway is an owner. At
``availability.replicas > 1`` the operator gives those replicas one shared volume —
``getDefaultStorageConfig`` switches the data PVC to ReadWriteMany on
``standard-rwx``, and ``useStatefulSet`` stays false without custom ReadWriteOnce
storage, so it is several pods against one PVC rather than one volume each. A
rolling update then runs this in a new pod while an old pod is still up
(``maxSurge`` is 25%, which rounds up to 1 of 2, so a new pod is admitted
before the last old one is gone; ``maxUnavailable`` is an absolute 1, so one
old pod also stays while it starts).

What that costs is bounded but real, and stating it precisely matters more than
naming a mechanism:

* Concurrent runs of this script cannot tear ``jobs.json`` — ``write_json`` names
  its temp file per *pod* (see ``writer_tag``; the pid alone is not distinct
  across replicas), so every ``os.replace`` publishes a whole file — but two of
  them can still lose one merge to the other. The loser retries next boot.
* A merge racing a live scheduler's own write is the case that does not
  self-correct. If a tick's write lands between this script's ``jobs.json`` write
  and its ledger write, the job is absent from the volume with its id recorded as
  installed, which ``reconcile`` reads as "removed on purpose" on that boot and
  every boot after it.

How wide that second window is depends on whether Hermes' ``mark_job_run``
re-reads the store or writes back a list cached at tick time. This module does not
know, and neither did the comment that used to assert the latter here. It is
recorded as unverified because nobody has read ``/opt/hermes/cron/jobs.py`` to
settle it, and an unverified premise stated as fact is what put the wrong claim
here in the first place.

Neither is fixable from inside this script: the competing writer is a scheduler in
another pod that takes no lock this one could hold. Running the reconcile once per
volume — behind leader election, or from an init container or per-rollout Job —
is the fix, and it is a change to the deployment topology rather than to this file.
Single-replica installs, which are the default, are unaffected.

    allowlist of "runtime-owned" names has to be complete to be correct, and it
    is complete only against the Hermes that was current when it was written:
    the day upstream records something new per job, this function starts erasing
    it on every pod start, silently, and nothing here can tell.

    That is not hypothetical. ``tools/cronjob_tools.py`` reads ``last_status``
