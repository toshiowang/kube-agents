"""Dispatcher for the ``bootstrap-inventory-scan`` cron job.

First-time onboarding needs a full GKE discovery sweep (control plane options,
node pools, Workload Identity, running workloads): the sweep writes the
complete findings to ``INVENTORY.raw.md``, and a second card ranks them into
the short report the user receives. That is LLM work AND privileged work, and the
profile this cron runs on can do neither: the Chat Agent's toolsets are
deliberately stripped to ``mcp-router`` + ``kanban`` (no terminal, no gcloud,
no kubectl), so it cannot run the sweep itself even as an LLM job.

Nor can the job simply move to ``platform``. Every marker that makes onboarding
once-only — ``.bootstrap_scan_filed`` below, ``.bootstrap_completed``,
``INVENTORY.raw.md``, and the ``INVENTORY.md`` the delivery job reads — lives
in the Chat Agent's home, and a
job on the platform profile would gate itself on a different directory. (Cron
on a named profile does now fire, via ``profile_cron_tick.py``; that is no
longer the reason this lives here.)

So this runs as a ``no_agent`` script — a plain subprocess, not bound by the
Chat Agent's toolset denylist — and files the sweep as a **kanban task assigned
to** ``platform``, the privileged specialist. The dispatcher spawns that worker
with its full toolset; the worker writes the raw findings, files the
prioritization card, and completes its own card.

Filing is once-only, and this job owns that guarantee locally: the id of the
card it filed is recorded in ``.bootstrap_scan_filed``, and while that marker
exists no further card is ever filed. The board's ``idempotency_key`` is kept
as a second line of defence for the one window the marker cannot cover (the
card was created but the run died before the marker was written) — but it is
not the guarantee. It cannot be: it dedupes against non-archived rows in one
board's database, so an archived card, a recreated board, or a reset volume
would hand a 1-minute cron job licence to launch a fresh fleet-wide sweep
every single minute. That is the "bootstrap ran several times" failure.

The marker is also what makes a delegated sweep safe, and that is what broke
here. When the sweep first fanned out to subagents, the card this job filed
completed almost immediately — the worker of that era delegated to
per-cluster child cards plus an aggregation card and finished, so the board
said "done" while the disk said "no report" for the whole sweep, which is
indistinguishable from "never scanned" — and a 1-minute job with no memory of
its own re-filed the sweep, once a minute, for as long as the real work took.
The sweep card now stays open until it has waited out its children and
written ``INVENTORY.raw.md`` itself (#1010 retired the complete-at-fan-out
shape), which narrows that window without closing it: ``INVENTORY.md`` still
appears minutes later, from the prioritization card the sweep files, and a
crashed sweep still leaves board-done/disk-empty. Only a marker written at
file time covers every case.

Deleting ``.bootstrap_scan_filed`` — together with ``INVENTORY.raw.md``, which
nothing else ever removes and which ``should_skip`` also gates on — is the
supported way to re-arm discovery after a sweep has genuinely failed. Deleting
the marker alone leaves the gate closed.

Output is intentionally empty: ``deliver: local`` plus empty stdout means the
scheduler treats every run as silent. The report reaches the user through
``bootstrap_delivery.py``, not through this job.

    ``/opt/data/profiles`` is a mirror that leaves out every ``config.yaml``
    (so no ``cluster_identity``) and keeps profiles the reconcile has pruned.
    This process runs in the agent pod next to the real profiles, and only
    after ``ensure_cluster_agents`` returns True, so the list is the roster the
    reconcile left, or once it has given up, whatever roster exists.

    ``cluster_agent_profile`` resolves the profiles under this process's

        "complete while resting on invented data.\n\n"
        "**The step numbers below are the inventory SOP's** — the numbering is aligned so a "
        "reference to a step means the same thing in both documents.\n\n"
        "**Step 1 — do not reconcile the roster yourself.** This gate already ran "
        f"`{RECONCILE_SCRIPT_NAME}`, and profile lifecycle belongs to that script alone: it "
        f"holds {lifecycle_holds} and the create/prune rules, so a profile you "
        "make by calling `cluster_agent_profile.py` directly is one the next reconcile run may "
        "immediately prune, and you will loop. Do not run it, and do not repair or delete a "
        "profile.\n\n"
        "**The roster may be empty or incomplete, and that is your finding to report, not "
        "yours to fix.** It says which clusters can audit themselves — not which clusters "
        f"count. Audit {every_cluster}: the ones with no Cluster Agent you take "
        "yourself in Step 4, and the report names each one as lacking an agent. A fleet swept "
        "without Cluster Agents is a degraded sweep and must read as one, because this report "
        "is delivered to the user as the state of their environment. If you cannot list "
        f"{cannot_list} at all, put that at the top of the report and file it anyway — "
        "onboarding runs once, and a report saying discovery failed is worth more than a thin "
        "one that reads as a clean fleet.\n\n"
        f"{_scope_gap_paragraph(_data_dir())}"
        "**Step 2 — fan out.** These are the Cluster Agents, one card each, read from the "
        "profiles when this card was filed. Make every call below exactly once, all of them "
        "up front:\n\n"
        f"{calls}\n\n"
        "This list is the roster. Do not look it up yourself: your terminal runs in a sandbox "
        "that has neither `hermes` nor the profiles' configuration, so anything you list there "
        "is incomplete. Pass no `parents` on these calls: a card with this one as its parent "
        "cannot start until this card completes, and this card waits for them in Step 3. "
        "**If no calls are listed above, there are no Cluster Agents: skip the rest of "
        "this step and do the whole sweep yourself in Step 4, following Steps 2 to 4 of the "
        "single-cluster audit SOP (its own numbering) for each cluster so the topology and the "
        "workload checks both happen.** That is the normal case for a "
        "single-cluster install and it is not an error.\n\n"
        "Each card's body must "
        "send that agent to the single-cluster audit SOP, reading whichever of these exists:\n"
        f"{cluster_audit_list}\n\n"
        "and tell it to complete its card with the structured `metadata` that SOP specifies. "
        "**Point at the SOP; do not describe the checks in the card body.** Both the checks and "
        "the `metadata` shape the aggregation stage reads are specific, and a body written "
        "freehand loses them: what comes back is a topology listing with no findings in it. "
        "Each Cluster Agent is read-only and pinned to its own "
        "cluster, so these run in parallel and none can touch another's. "
        "**Step 3 — wait for the children on this card.** Poll each child with "
        "`kanban_show(<id>)`, running `sleep 60` between polling rounds (double it once the wait passes five minutes), until every one is "
        "`done` or `archived`; their structured `metadata` is how you collect the results. Do "
        "NOT complete this card while they are unfinished — completing is how a card hands back "
        "its final result, a dispatch receipt is not the report, and the board refuses such a "
        "completion — and do NOT `kanban_block` on them (that deadlocks; see the inventory SOP). "
        "Steps 4 and 5 below are your job, in this same run, once the children settle; the "
        "full mechanics are in Step 3 of the inventory SOP above.\n\n"
        "**Use those exact idempotency keys.** This is onboarding: it must happen once. The "
        "keys are what guarantees that a retry, a second dispatch, or a duplicate of this "
        "card re-attaches to the sweep already in flight instead of launching a second "
        "fleet-wide scan on top of it.\n\n"
        "**Step 4 — write the raw findings** (here, once the children have settled — or "
        "immediately if there were no Cluster Agents to fan out to). Audit any cluster the roster did not "
        "cover yourself, and combine those findings "
        "with every child's metadata into a COMPLETE, verbose findings file at "
        f"`{RAW_INVENTORY_PATH}` — the full fleet and workload tables and the full set of SRE "
        "remediation suggestions. Do not summarize and do not trim for length: this file is the "
        "only record of what the sweep saw, and the next stage reads it and nothing else.\n\n"
        f"**Step 5 — file the prioritization card, then complete this one.** "
        f"`{RAW_INVENTORY_PATH}` is not what the user "
        "receives. Once it is on disk, file exactly one card — "
        f"`kanban_create(assignee='{SCAN_ASSIGNEE}', "
        f"idempotency_key='{PRIORITIZE_IDEMPOTENCY_KEY}', "
        "parents=[<this card's id>], ...)` — `parents` matters: it queues the ranking to run "
        "after you finish, which is what lets your own `kanban_complete` close this card while "
        "the ranking is still pending. Tell that worker to follow "
        "the prioritization SOP, reading whichever of these exists:\n"
        f"{prioritize_list}\n\n"
        f"Its input is `{RAW_INVENTORY_PATH}` and its output is `{INVENTORY_PATH}`, the ranked "
        "report a separate delivery job posts to the user **verbatim, with no further editing**. "
        f"`{INVENTORY_PATH}` is the Chat Agent's home, not yours; writing it anywhere else means "
        "the user never receives it.\n\n"
        "**Do not rank the findings yourself, and do not write "
        f"`{INVENTORY_PATH}` from this card.** Ranking runs separately so it sees the raw "
        "findings and nothing else. Done inline it would rank them against your whole sweep "
        "transcript instead, which changes the report depending on how the sweep went.\n\n"
        "If a cluster's scan fails or its agent never reports, say so explicitly in the raw "
        "findings rather than omitting the cluster — a silent gap reads as 'clean'.\n\n"
        "Then finish by calling `kanban_complete`: `result` is a short factual account of the "
        f"sweep (clusters audited, findings count, that the full findings are at "
        f"`{RAW_INVENTORY_PATH}` and ranking is queued). Completing is what releases the "
        "prioritization card to run.\n\n"
