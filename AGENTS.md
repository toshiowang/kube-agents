# AGENTS.md

## Project Overview

This repository contains the Kubernetes Agentic Harness (`kube-agents`). It is a collection of agent configurations, personas, and skills designed to manage Kubernetes/GKE operations. It utilizes a Platform Agent to transition from reactive manual management to proactive, intent-driven operations.

## Repository Layout

- `agents/`: Source of truth for agent blueprints (personas and skills).
  - `chat/`: The Planning Agent front door — the `default` Hermes profile that receives chat ingress, plans the work, and delegates each piece to a specialist.
  - `platform/`: Configuration for the Platform Agent, scaffolded at pod startup into the `platform` profile.
  - `cluster/`: The Cluster Agent profile _template_ (persona, scoped config, and runtime-debugging skills). The Platform Agent scaffolds this into per-cluster Hermes profiles at runtime; it is not deployed directly.
  - `contributor/`: The contributor-agent protocol: the claim/PR/review/escalation loop for external bots (e.g. Kyber, Codebot Robot) coordinating over GitHub alone. Not a runtime blueprint; not shipped in the images.
- `.agents/skills/`: Repository-level skills, not shipped in the agent images — review skills (adversarial change review, security audits, docs-drift, skill quality) run against pull requests and clusters, with `review-preflight` running the pre-PR set of them in a context that did not write the change, plus the `install-kube-agents`/`uninstall-kube-agents`/`upgrade-kube-agents` lifecycle skills that drive the repository's installer scripts.
- `.agents/rules/`: Repository-level rules an agent follows, one file per family and none shipped in the agent images — `core_engineering.md` for the code itself, `github_actions.md` for workflow authoring, `pre_pr_review.md` for the mechanics of the two pre-PR passes. This file states each rule and links there for the form it takes; the split keeps `AGENTS.md` inside the context budget `scripts/check_context_budget.py` enforces.
- `a2a/`: Go module for the agent-to-agent bus — wire-protocol library and `a2a` topics CLI per `docs/designs/spec-a2a-payloads.md`, plus agent profiles. Nothing imports it yet.
- `charts/`: Canonical Helm charts (`kube-agents`) for deploying the Kube-Agents operator and profiles.
- `terraform/`: Companion reusable Terraform modules (`gke-cluster`, `kube-agents-iam`, `chat-pubsub`, `github-minter`, `gke-backup-plan`, `drift-pubsub`) for infrastructure provisioning, plus `examples/full-install/`, the single-apply composition that installs the Helm chart on top. `drift-pubsub` is not yet part of that composition.
- `deploy/`: Deployment infrastructure code (Dockerfile, Kustomize bases, shared runtime assets).
- `docs/`: Documentation.
  - `site/`: The published documentation site (Astro + Starlight) — the canonical home for
    user-facing docs.
  - `architecture/`: The end-state architecture specification (`01`–`09`). Describes the target, not
    what ships today.
  - `designs/`: Per-feature design documents.
- `k8s-operator/`: Go/Kubebuilder operator reconciling `PlatformAgent` Custom Resources.
- `scripts/`: Repository tooling — `installer/` (what the front doors share), `dev/`, `release/`.
- `examples/`: Example integrations (LiteLLM provider configs, vLLM serving, inference replay).
- `bench/`: Evaluation harness that runs [kubernetes-sigs/devops-bench](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/devops-bench) against the Platform Agent as a pip-installed library.
- `images.json`: Inventory of every container image an install pulls, with its upstream reference
  and pin. Read by `make mirror-images`, the kustomize deploy targets, and the docs generator.
- `INSTALL.md`: Installation guide.
- `README.md`: Project overview.

## Where Tests Go

Tests live in eleven places here, with different runners and different answers to "does this catch a
regression before merge". Choosing the wrong one rarely fails loudly — the test runs somewhere you
did not expect, or nowhere at all, and the suite reports green around it.

**Decide by asking whether a model call is in the loop.**

- **No** — it is a test, and it runs on every pull request. Put it beside the module it covers; in
  `tests/` when there is nothing to sit beside, as for a shell script or a rendered manifest; or in
  `tests/integration/` when it spans two components — but in `bench/tests/` when one of those
  components is the bench harness, which `tests/integration/` cannot import.
  See [`tests/integration/README.md`](tests/integration/README.md).
  One carve-out: **security and permissions invariants** go in `tests/conformance/`, whose own
  README is the contract.
- **Yes, and you plant the defect it has to find** — it is an eval, it belongs in
  `bench/tasks/<name>/task.yaml`, and it runs in the Prow presubmit, so adding one changes what
  every pull request reports. [`docs/designs/bench-case-format.md`](docs/designs/bench-case-format.md)
  is the contract for what that file must carry; `make bench-case-check` checks it locally
  and `scripts/test_task_registration.py` gates it.
- **Yes, and it checks an install you already have** — it is a critical user journey, and it goes in
  `bench/cuj/`. **This tier is manual by design**, not pending automation: it needs a real
  deployment to point at and CI has none, so no job runs it and adding one changes nothing about
  what CI reports. It plants nothing, so it grades the deployment rather than the agent.
  See [`bench/cuj/README.md`](bench/cuj/README.md).
- **Yes, and it is the release gate** — `tests/e2e/`, which the release-candidate pipeline runs on a
  schedule. Adding to it holds up releases rather than pull requests.

One rule holds wherever it lands: a new test directory only runs if a `PYTHON_TEST_DIRS` glob in the
`Makefile` reaches it, and a directory the globs miss fails nothing — it sits unexecuted while the
suite reports green around it. Add the glob in the same change — `tests/conformance/` excepted,
deliberately; its README says why.

The eleven homes, what runs each, and how far "runs on a pull request" is from "gates a merge" are in
[`docs/testing-map.md`](docs/testing-map.md).

## Agent Setup & Integration

This repository is primarily configuration and documentation for AI agents. The main exceptions are the Go modules — the operator in `k8s-operator/` and the A2A bus in `a2a/` — which require compilation (see Local Validation Checks below).

To use these agents:

1. Follow the instructions in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) to set up and register the Platform Agent in your agent harness.
2. Refer to the documentation site content in [docs/site/src/content/docs/](docs/site/src/content/docs/) for architecture, concepts, and operational guides.

## Before Starting a Task

### Branch from a `main` you have just fetched

`main` takes roughly ten commits a day, so a week-old checkout is a different
repository. Reading a stale tree answers your questions about code that no
longer exists, and the plan you build can be wrong in ways no care during the
work will catch. Always fetch first, and branch from the fetched ref:

```bash
# `upstream` here is whichever remote points at gke-labs/kube-agents; on a clone of
# the upstream repository rather than a fork, that is `origin`. Every command in this
# section names it, so substitute throughout rather than in one line.
git fetch upstream main

# --no-track matters. Branching from a remote-tracking ref otherwise sets the new
# branch to track upstream/main, and a bare `git push` later then proposes
# `git push upstream HEAD:main` -- a push to the upstream repository, which Pull
# Request Hygiene below forbids. Publish to your fork: `git push -u <fork> <branch>`.
git switch -c <branch> --no-track upstream/main
```

Already partway into a branch when you read this, or picking one back up after a few days? Being
behind is not itself the problem — forty commits touching nothing you care about cost you nothing.
What wastes work is `main` moving _underneath the files you are changing_. Measure that with the
drift check in
[`docs/pull-request-workflow.md`](docs/pull-request-workflow.md#measure-how-far-a-branch-has-drifted-from-main),
which lists the files you are changing that `main` has also changed since you diverged. Anything it
lists, rebase onto `upstream/main` and re-read those files before you write more, because what you
have already read about them may no longer be true. Nothing listed, and being behind is a
merge-conflict risk to settle later, not a reason to stop.

This subsection is the canonical statement of the requirement; the site's
[contributing guide](docs/site/src/content/docs/contributing.md) summarises it — change this
first, then reconcile that to it.

### Check whether someone is already doing it

Many people and agents work in this repository at once, so the next step of a non-trivial task
is finding out whether someone is already doing it. Scan the open work and report what you find
to the user **before** you write code. Skip the scan only when the user has already named the
issue or pull request you are working on, or when the change is a one-liner they asked for
directly.

The queries are in
[`docs/pull-request-workflow.md`](docs/pull-request-workflow.md#check-whether-someone-is-already-doing-it).
Then report before you start:

- **An open pull request touches your files or solves your problem.** Give the number, author,
  and URL, and say how your task differs. Do not push to someone else's branch and do not open
  a competing pull request without the user's go-ahead. Overlap alone is a merge-conflict
  warning, not a stop sign — say which it is.
- **An open issue describes the task and is unassigned.** Give the number and title, offer to
  claim it, and say what you would comment. Assign or comment only after the user agrees — and
  the account whose token you hold is a person, so you are volunteering them, not yourself.
- **The issue is assigned to someone else.** Report it and ask before starting anything.
- **Nothing matches.** Say so in one line and carry on.

Carry the result into the pull request's **Context** section — `Closes #<number>`, or the
related open pull request and how yours differs.
[`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) already reserves that
section for it.

This is not the `status:in-progress` claim in
[`agents/platform/skills/github-issue-resolver/SKILL.md`](agents/platform/skills/github-issue-resolver/SKILL.md).
That is the deployed Platform Agent claiming an issue on a user's repository at runtime. Here
the assignee is the claim; do not apply `status:` labels to issues in this repository.

## Skills Guidelines

- Skills live under `agents/platform/skills/` (Platform Agent) and `agents/cluster/skills/` (Cluster Agent); each skill directory holds a `SKILL.md` written for an AI agent.
- Place a skill by persona: fleet, provisioning and GitOps-write skills belong to the Platform Agent; read-only, single-cluster runtime-debugging skills belong to the Cluster Agent.
- `agents/platform/skills/gke-*` are mirrors of `google/skills`: `scripts/sync-upstream-skills.py` rewrites them wholesale and a test checks them against `scripts/upstream_skills_lock.json`. Do not edit them directly; add a `SKILL_SUBSTITUTIONS` or `SKILL_FOOTERS` entry there and rerun the sync.

## Engineering Rules

Rules an agent follows live in [`.agents/rules/`](.agents/rules/), one file per family — the code
itself here, [workflow authoring](.agents/rules/github_actions.md) and
[the pre-PR passes](.agents/rules/pre_pr_review.md) under Pull Request Hygiene below. Read the file
that covers what you are writing before you write it.

- **No magic constants.** Every hardcoded value — number, string, duration, path, limit — gets a
  name declared at the top of the file, after the imports and before the first function. It binds
  the lines you write, not the file they land in: literals already in a file you are editing stay
  put unless you are touching them. Go, Python, and Bash; not Terraform, YAML, or Helm. Exempt:
  `0`, `1`, `-1`, `""`, a literal that is the subject of its line, and test files, where the
  literal is the expected value.
  [`.agents/rules/core_engineering.md`](.agents/rules/core_engineering.md) gives the form per
  language and why no linter enforces it yet.

## Documentation Guidelines

Every fact has one home. Duplicating documentation across files is how it goes stale, so before
adding a paragraph, check whether the topic already has an owner:

| Content                                                  | Canonical home                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| User-facing narrative, how-to, and reference             | `docs/site/src/content/docs/`                |
| End-state architecture                                   | `docs/architecture/`                         |
| Per-feature design rationale                             | `docs/designs/`                              |
| Shared installer defaults and the `install.env` model    | `scripts/installer/README.md`                |
| Which container images an install pulls, and their pins  | `images.json`                                |
| The install procedure (self-contained, agent-executable) | `INSTALL.md`                                 |
| The commands behind this file's pull-request rules       | `docs/pull-request-workflow.md`              |
| What the agent is and is not permitted to do             | the site's `reference/security-and-iam.md`   |
| How to develop a specific directory                      | that directory's `README.md` (keep it short) |
| Rules an agent follows, by family (code, CI, pre-PR)     | `.agents/rules/`                             |

Rules:

- **Do not hand-write a table that mirrors a machine-readable file.** The cron schedule, the skill
  catalogue, and the container-image inventory are generated into
  `<!-- BEGIN GENERATED -->` regions by `scripts/generate_docs.py`, which also writes
  `docs/family-roster.txt` whole. Edit the source, then run `make docs-generate`.
- **Do not restate the `make` targets.** `make help` prints them from the Makefile. New targets get
  a `## description` comment.
- **Link rather than summarise** when another page already owns the topic. If you must summarise,
  say which page is canonical, the way the site's credential-isolation page defers to
  `docs/credential-isolation-design.md`.
- **Do not document pull-request status.** Docs describe the current state of `main`; a merged PR
  leaves that prose silently stale.
- **Verify identifiers against source, not against other docs.** GCP service account names live
  in `install.defaults.env`, the Go version in `k8s-operator/go.mod`.
- **Add a document to the map (`docs/README.md`) with one line, and change nothing else there.**
  Write the row in the compact `| cell | cell |` form and never re-align a table: the map is edited
  from several branches every week, and a re-aligned table rewrites rows your PR did not author.
  `docs/README.md` §5 owns the rest of that contract — including why a file inside an existing
  family needs no map edit at all.
- **Write it straight.** Lead with the fact — no preamble, no restating the question, no "it's
  worth noting". Cut hype and self-assessment (`comprehensive`, `robust`, `seamless`, `simply`,
  `powerful`). Skip the "not X, but Y" antithesis and rule-of-three padding: one precise example
  beats three synonyms. Prefer prose to a `**Bold term:** explanation` list. Claim first, caveat
  after; a hedge in front of a fact hides it. `SKILL.md` files are the exception to the prose
  preference — `.agents/skills/skill-review/SKILL.md` asks for terse imperative bullets there.
- **Match a document's length to what the task needs.** Agent-written documents run long by
  default, so cover the substance and stop: no filler sections, no summary that repeats the
  section above it, no boilerplate scaffolding a reader will skip. Anthropic's
  [Opus 5 prompting guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-opus-5)
  is the upstream source for this and for the conciseness rule above.

Run `make docs-check` before pushing. It verifies generated regions are current, relative links
resolve, identifiers match their source, every Markdown document outside the root dot-directories
has an entry in the documentation
map (`docs/README.md`), and this file plus `CLAUDE.md` stay inside the context budget
(`scripts/check_context_budget.py`) — the same five checks CI runs.

## Contributing as an agent

Unattended agents (collaborating on issues and PRs without a human in the loop)
must read [`agents/contributor/AGENTS.md`](agents/contributor/AGENTS.md). It
defines the agent-to-agent loop (claims, escalations, and review tiers) and
governs where unattended execution conflicts with "ask the user" clauses here.
Agents with a user in the loop follow this file.

## Pull Request Hygiene

- Keep changes scoped to the request.
- Do not commit unrelated formatting changes.
- Maintain the structure and intent of the agent configuration files.
- **Conventional Commits & PR Title Enforcement:** All PR titles and commit messages must strictly adhere to the Conventional Commits specification (`type(optional-scope): description`):
  - **Permitted Types:** `feat` (new user-facing capability), `fix` (bug fix), `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`.
  - **Breaking Changes:** Mark with `!` before the colon (e.g. `feat!:`, `fix(operator)!:`) or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.
  - **Release Preparation:** Standardized PR titles ensure consistent commit history and establish the Conventional Commit metadata required for the automated SemVer release pipeline. AI agents must ensure the proposed PR title prefix accurately reflects the changes in the branch diff and confirm classification with the author before opening a PR.
- Push PR branches to a fork, not to the upstream repository.
- **Pin every third-party GitHub Action to a full commit SHA with the version in a trailing
  comment** (`uses: actions/checkout@3d3c42e… # v7.0.1`), and **guard automatically-triggered
  credentialed workflows against forks** with `if: github.repository == 'gke-labs/kube-agents'` on
  every job. A mutable tag lets a retagged release change what CI runs; an unguarded job fails on
  every fork sync and mails the fork owner. No check in this repository blocks either one, and
  both have exemptions — local reusable workflows need no pin, a `workflow_call`- or
  `workflow_dispatch`-only workflow needs no guard, and `docs-deploy.yml` is unguarded on purpose
  so a fork can publish its own Pages site. Open
  [`.agents/rules/github_actions.md`](.agents/rules/github_actions.md) whenever you touch a
  `uses:` line or a workflow trigger.
- Use `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` for PR body structure and level of
  detail. Do not use `--fill` with `gh pr create` as it bypasses the template.
- **AI Agent Attribution & Commit Authorship:**
  - Do not add AI agents as git commit co-authors or include `Co-Authored-By:` trailers in commit messages.
  - Note AI assistance in the PR description (e.g. `Generated with the help of <Agent/Model>.`).
- **Write PR titles, bodies, commit messages, and review replies the same way** the Documentation
  Guidelines' "Write it straight" rule requires: what changed and why, in plain declaratives. Do
  not grade your own work — "comprehensive", "significantly improves", and "production-ready" are
  claims the diff either supports or does not, and the reviewer is the one who decides. Lead with
  the outcome: the first sentence of a PR body, a review reply, or a report back to the user
  answers "what happened", and the supporting detail follows it.
- **Adversarial self-review before opening a PR, and record it in the PR body.** Run the
  `review-adversarial` skill (`.agents/skills/review-adversarial/SKILL.md`) against your branch
  diff **in a context that did not write the change** — a subagent or a fresh session handed the
  diff range and nothing else, which `/pr-preflight` spawns for you. Invoking it is also the
  request to delegate that an agent is otherwise told to wait for, so an agent that skips it
  reviews the diff in the context that argued for it. Fix what the pass confirms, and fill in the
  template's **Self-Review** section with what you looked for, what it found, and the disposition
  of each finding. This is a required pre-PR step for AI agents working in this repository: you
  are the change's first hostile reader, and a reviewer who has to find what you could have found
  spends their attention on the wrong things.
  The section carries every pre-PR pass, not this one alone — the docs-drift pass below runs on
  every change too — merged into one list, so a reviewer reads what was looked for in one place
  rather than inferring which passes ran from which findings appeared.
  This bullet and [`.agents/rules/pre_pr_review.md`](.agents/rules/pre_pr_review.md) are together
  the canonical statement — the requirement here, the mechanics there (why the clean context has
  to be a real one, what to do when your harness will not spawn one, and the disposition every
  finding owes). The site's [contributing guide](docs/site/src/content/docs/contributing.md) and
  the comment in [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) summarise
  the pair — change this bullet or `pre_pr_review.md`, whichever owns what you are changing, then
  reconcile the summaries to it.
- **Docs-drift review before opening a PR:** run the `review-docs-drift` skill
  (`.agents/skills/review-docs-drift/SKILL.md`) against your branch diff and address its
  Blocking findings. This is a required pre-PR step for AI agents working in this repository;
  `make docs-check` enforces only the mechanical subset (generated regions, links, terminology,
  map coverage, context budget), while the skill also verifies that doc prose still matches the
  source. Its dispositions go in **Self-Review** with the adversarial pass's, not in a section of
  their own. `/pr-preflight` runs this pass alongside the adversarial one, each in its own context.
- **Live-test the change before opening a PR, and describe it in the PR body.** Every pull
  request fills in the template's **Testing → Live validation** section with how the change was
  exercised against a real, running kube-agents installation — see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) if
  you do not have one. Green unit tests and a clean `make docs-check` are necessary, not
  sufficient: they cannot tell you whether the operator reconciled the change or the agent pod
  picked it up. This bullet and
  [`.agents/rules/pre_pr_review.md`](.agents/rules/pre_pr_review.md) are together the canonical
  statement — the requirement here, the mechanics there (what to name and observe, how to prove
  the mechanism rather than a coincidence, the screenshot and shared-install lease rules, and what
  to write when the change cannot reach an installation at all). The site's
  [contributing guide](docs/site/src/content/docs/contributing.md) and the comment in
  [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) summarise the pair —
  change this bullet or `pre_pr_review.md`, whichever owns what you are changing, then reconcile
  the summaries to it.
- **Keep these sections current, not chronological.** **Self-Review** and **Live validation** tell
  a reviewer at a glance what has been reviewed and exercised against the branch as it stands. A
  second pass — after review findings, after a rebase — folds into what is there rather than being
  appended beneath it: work that still holds stays and is not re-run just to have been run against
  the new head, a check the new commits invalidated is re-run or kept with a line saying it no
  longer reaches the head, and new findings join the rest. What a re-run drops is the superseded
  round, not the contents these sections owe a reviewer — the angles you ran, the layers you
  observed, what you could not cover. Round-by-round history of a _reviewer's_ findings is the
  exception: it belongs in the threads, where a reply naming the fix and its commit stays attached
  to the finding it answers.
- **The install has one engine: Terraform + Helm.** `terraform/examples/full-install`
  (through its `lifecycle.sh`) owns every GCP resource and the chart owns every
  Kubernetes resource; `install.sh` / `uninstall.sh` / `upgrade.sh` are front doors
  that generate `terraform.tfvars` and drive it. Do not add a second expression of an
  install step — a kubectl-applied manifest a chart template already renders, a gcloud
  call the composition already makes. The two places manifests still exist twice on
  purpose (`k8s-operator/config/crd` + `config/rbac` mirrored into the chart by
  `make chart-check`, and the kustomize integration manifests kept in step with the
  chart templates for the dev path) each have a check or a comment saying so.
- **Expect an automated review after opening a PR.** Opening the pull request starts
  `kube-agents-bot`; see
  [Automated Review After Opening a Pull Request](#automated-review-after-opening-a-pull-request)
  for what it does and what you are expected to do with its findings.
- **Leave no conversation unresolved.** `main` will not merge while a review thread is open, and
  the open thread also keeps the pull request counted as
  [its author's outstanding work](docs/pull-request-workflow.md#who-owns-an-open-pull-request).
  Reply, then resolve every thread you are confident is addressed — the bar for "confident" is in
  [Automated Review After Opening a Pull Request](#automated-review-after-opening-a-pull-request),
  and the commands, with the ways a thread listing reads clear when it is not, are in
  [`docs/pull-request-workflow.md`](docs/pull-request-workflow.md#resolving-conversations).
- **You do not merge it; Tide does.** Once a reviewer's `lgtm` label and an `OWNERS` approver's
  `approved` are both on the pull request and the required checks are green, `google-oss-prow`
  squash-merges it. Posting `/lgtm` or `/approve` is therefore merging the change, not reviewing
  it: do not send either on someone's behalf unless they asked.
  [`docs/pull-request-workflow.md`](docs/pull-request-workflow.md#how-a-change-merges) is canonical
  — the labels, `OWNERS`, `/hold`, and why GitHub's settings page reads as though nothing is
  required.
- **Local Validation Checks:** Before committing, run what your change touches — `prettier --write`
  on changed Markdown and YAML, a local Docker build of the agent runner, the image-layer budget if
  you added a `RUN` or `COPY` to `deploy/docker/Dockerfile`, and `go build` inside whichever Go
  module you touched (`k8s-operator/`, `a2a/`).
  Each has a constraint that costs a CI run to rediscover — the pinned prettier version, the
  mandatory `--platform linux/amd64`, the layer ceiling that only fails after merge. The
  commands and those reasons are in
  [`docs/pull-request-workflow.md`](docs/pull-request-workflow.md#local-validation-before-committing).

### The behavioural presubmit gate

`pull-kube-agents-smoke-test` runs the eval matrix in `hack/ci-eval-pr.sh` — every active case,
three repetitions each — and has been merge-blocking since 2026-09-02
(GoogleCloudPlatform/oss-test-infra#2677). It is slow — recent green runs took 1.5 to 3.5 hours
against a 360-minute ceiling — and a push restarts it unless only inert paths changed (step 0), so
open the pull request early and batch changes. Another pull request merging usually does not — the
green status is re-pinned to `main`'s new head
([how a change merges](docs/pull-request-workflow.md#how-a-change-merges)).

Two things red it. A case on the `BOOTSTRAP_ADMITTED` roster in `hack/ci-eval-pr.sh` fails **all**
of its repetitions — one failed repetition out of three does nothing on its own. Or any case,
admitted or not, trips an absolute rung: a forbidden cluster mutation, a verifier that errored
instead of running, or a record whose liveness signals are inconsistent (one showing no run at
all is excluded as infrastructure instead, #1184). Repetitions classified as
infrastructure failures are excluded from the verdict automatically, unless every case hits one —
a suite that evaluated nothing reds rather than reporting green. The roster is the source of truth
for what is admitted, `docs/eval-gate-roster.md` for demotion, and
[`docs/designs/testing-strategy.md`](docs/designs/testing-strategy.md) §4.2 for the full verdict
ladder.

On a red, ask whether your diff explains it. If yes, fix it. If no, file an issue with the
`presubmit-gate` label; if the cause is evident and the fix is quick, fixing it yourself is
welcome — otherwise keep working while the eval crew classifies it. One `/retest` is reasonable
for a suspected transient; repeated blind retests are noise. Never merge around a red gate, and
never instruct anyone to.

`/override` (admin-only) is only for a red the eval crew classified as not the pull request's;
the rest of the override mechanics, and why an approved, green pull request can sit unmerged,
are in [how a change merges](docs/pull-request-workflow.md#how-a-change-merges) (#1202).

## Automated Review After Opening a Pull Request

Every pull request here is reviewed automatically by `kube-agents-bot`, a GitHub App that runs a
coding agent over the branch diff. It only comments — it never pushes commits and never merges.
Opening a pull request is therefore not the end of the task. The bot introduces itself in a comment
on every pull request it picks up, and that comment states its current contract; if it disagrees
with what follows, believe the comment and fix this section.
[`docs/pull-request-workflow.md`](docs/pull-request-workflow.md#the-automated-review) holds the
mechanics: how long a review takes, the commands to poll for one, and how to reply to a finding —
with [resolving the threads](docs/pull-request-workflow.md#resolving-conversations) alongside it.

**What any reviewer reads first — human or agent, this bot included.** Read the pull request's
**Self-Review** section before the diff. It tells you what the author already looked for, what they
found, and what they consciously chose not to fix, so the review can start where theirs stopped.
Three things to do with it:

- **Absent, empty, or a bare "reviewed it"** → say so as the first thing you report. The section is
  required (see Pull Request Hygiene) and an unanswered one is the finding.
- **A claim it makes that the diff does not support** → that is a finding in its own right, and a
  more serious one than most defects: it misdirects every reader after you.
- **A finding the author rejected with a reason** → engage with the reason. Restating the finding
  as though the reason were not there wastes both of you.

**When it runs.** On `opened`, `reopened`, and draft-marked-ready. **Pushing more commits does not
start another review** — an active branch would otherwise pay for a re-read on every push. To get a
fresh review of the current commit, comment `/review` on a line of its own (repository owners,
members, and collaborators only) — that pass is the strict one, only what the bot is certain of,
while `/review all` re-reads at the width of the automatic first review and includes findings it
believes are real without being sure. The `agent:ignore` label opts a pull request out entirely and
outranks both.

**A human reviewer is requested only once its check passes.** The bot posts an `AI Review` check
run alongside its review — `success` when it found nothing, `neutral` when it did — and
`.github/workflows/auto_request_review.yml` waits for that check to go green before assigning
anyone from `.github/auto_request_review.yml`. Opening a pull request no longer pings a human, so
clearing the findings and commenting `/review` for a clean pass is what puts the change in front of
a reviewer. Two exceptions: a pull request opened by a bot is assigned as soon as the check
completes, whatever the conclusion, because Dependabot cannot re-run `/review` on itself; and an
owner, member, or collaborator can comment `/request-review` (at the start of the comment) to
assign a reviewer immediately — the override for a finding you have answered but disagree with, or
for a review that never arrived. Nothing here changes who is picked; that is still the config file.

**What agents must do.** After creating a pull request, tell the user the bot review is on its way
and **offer to wait for it** instead of reporting the work as finished — unless you opened a draft,
which is not in the queue at all until it is marked ready, so a wait started there never ends and
the bot is not broken for failing to answer it. A review that runs always reports back, so a
one-line "no findings" is a result rather than silence; a review that never arrives is a bug in the
bot, not a verdict, and the workflow doc says how long to wait and which trigger replaces the pass
you lost.

Then work the findings **with** the user rather than acting on them unilaterally: summarise each
one, say whether you think it should be fixed, pushed back on, or deferred, and let the user decide
before you change code. The bot is a reviewer, not an authority — but a finding you disagree with
gets answered in its thread, not silently dropped. After pushing fixes, remember that the push alone
does not re-trigger anything: ask the user whether to comment `/review` for another pass — `/review`
to confirm the fixes against a strict read, `/review all` when the branch changed enough that it
deserves a first-review-width look again.

Pushing fixes is also what makes the pull request body stale. Fixes that answer a finding, and any
live test you re-ran to confirm them, belong in **Self-Review** and **Live validation** — folded
into what is already there, per "Keep these sections current, not chronological" above. Do it once
the last `/review` pass has settled, for the reason the next paragraph gives about threads: a fresh
review brings fresh findings, and folding them in twice is the same wasted round. Nothing else in
this workflow reopens the body.

**Then resolve the conversations.** Pull Request Hygiene says why an open thread both blocks the
merge and keeps the change counted as its author's outstanding work; what belongs here is the
timing. Do it once the fixes are pushed and the last `/review` pass has settled: a fresh review
opens fresh threads, so resolving before it lands means doing it twice.

Resolve a thread — the bot's or a human's — when you are **fully confident the issue is addressed**:
the fix is on the pull request head and you can name the commit, or the finding is factually wrong
and you have said why. Check that second one against the merge target as it stands now, not against
your working copy — a finding that looks wrong because the file it cites does not say that is very
often a stale checkout rather than a wrong finding. Anything short of that stays open. A judgment
call, a reviewer asking for something you chose not to do, a rebuttal nobody has answered yet —
reply and leave it to them. Resolving says the conversation is finished; it is not a way to end a
disagreement. Reply first, always: a resolved thread collapses, so the reply naming what changed and
the commit that changed it is the only record the reviewer may ever see.

## Before Reviewing Someone Else's Pull Request

The section above is about your own pull request being reviewed, and it already says where a
reviewer starts: the **Self-Review** section, before the diff. This one is the question that comes
before even that — whether the review you have been asked for needs to happen at all.

By the time anyone asks, a pull request here has usually been read twice already: `kube-agents-bot`
reads every one, and "Pull Request Hygiene" separately required the author to run
`review-adversarial` over their own diff, record the result in **Self-Review**, and exercise the
change under **Live validation**. Where both of those hold and neither has gone stale, a third
hostile read is usually redundant spend.

So check for both first — and then **ask rather than decide**. Say what the evidence is and that
the extra round may be unnecessary; let the person who asked choose whether to spend it. Skipping a
review unilaterally is not yours to do, and neither is quietly running one you have reason to
believe nobody needs.

Two things make this go wrong quietly:

- **Currency.** A clean review sitting at an older commit proves nothing about the current head —
  unless the only commits since it are merges from the base branch, which are not new work to
  review. Treat a review whose commit has vanished from the branch as stale, not clean. An
  unresolved review thread says the same thing: work outstanding, however clean the latest review
  reads.
- **A Self-Review that is present but unanswered.** "No findings" counts only alongside what was
  looked for, so a bare "reviewed it" is an absent section with characters in it — and, per the
  section above, the first finding your review reports rather than a reason to skip it.

[`.claude/commands/pr-review-batch.md`](.claude/commands/pr-review-batch.md) is the canonical home
for the mechanics — the queries, what counts as a clean verdict, the verdicts they produce, and what
to put in front of the user. Follow it whether or not the review was started through the slash
command, and change it rather than this section when the mechanics move.
