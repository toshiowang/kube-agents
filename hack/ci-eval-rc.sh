# Release-candidate eval (the postsubmit job's entrypoint)
# ==============================================================================
# Resolve the newest release candidate, check it out, deploy its published
# images, and evaluate them. GATING: the verdict this writes is what decides
# whether the candidate reaches the staging cluster. Step 5 of
# staging-promotion-pipeline.yml polls this run's artifacts and pushes the
# staging_ tag staging-deploy.yml triggers on only when the summary below says
# GREEN. How wide that evaluation is, RC_EVAL_TIER below decides: the presubmit
# matrix, and deliberately not the full catalog, because the step that waits
# for this verdict gives up before the full catalog finishes.
#
# The word in the summary is the verdict, not this script's exit status, and the
# three-way split is why. An exit status has two values and this lane has three
# outcomes: a candidate that failed the catalog, a candidate that passed it, and
# a run that measured nothing at all -- a lease that never came, a deploy that
# failed, a dormancy gate. Collapsing the third into either of the others is a
# candidate held back for a broken lane or promoted on an eval that never ran.
#
# The four steps, and why they need a driver at all:
#
#   1. hack/resolve-rc-target.sh   -> the candidate's commit SHA
#   2. git checkout --detach       -> the tree becomes the candidate's
#   3. hack/ci-deploy.sh           -> installs the candidate's published images
#   4. hack/ci-eval-pr.sh          -> runs the catalog against them
#
# Step 2 needs a caller that outlives it. Bash reads a script incrementally as
# it executes and keeps a byte offset into the file, so a script that rewrites
# its own file mid-run can resume at that offset in different content. What
# happens then is not defined by anything you can check: measured on this
# repository it ranges from every step running normally to one silently
# skipped, varying with the file's size and where the read buffer happened to
# land. `git checkout` usually lands on the benign side because it replaces
# the file rather than truncating it, leaving the descriptor bash holds
# pointed at the intact original -- but "usually", for a failure that produces
# a green run with steps missing from it, is not a property to build on.
#
# So this file removes the question instead of answering it. Everything below
# is inside main(), which bash parses into memory in full before running any
# of it, and which exits rather than returning. Past `main "$@"` the file is
# never read from disk again, so it does not matter what the candidate's tree
# holds in its place -- a different version, or for any candidate cut before
# this lane existed, nothing at all. tests/test_ci_eval_rc.py runs that case
# against a real checkout that deletes this script mid-run.
#
# What runs after step 2 is the CANDIDATE's ci-deploy.sh and ci-eval-pr.sh,
# not this checkout's, and deliberately -- resolve-rc-target.sh's header has
# the reasoning. Only the images being the candidate's, while the chart, the
# CRDs and bench/tasks stay on main, would grade a build nobody is shipping.
# The corollary is that a candidate predating the RC deploy path cannot be
# measured by it, which is what the DEPLOY_RC_MARKER check below reports.
#
# Environment:
#   RC_EVAL_ENABLED   any non-empty value arms this script. Unset = dormant,
#                     one skip line, exit 0. The Prow job config arms it; until
#                     the companion oss-test-infra job exists this file is
#                     inert wherever it runs.
#   RC_TAG            pin a candidate instead of resolving the newest one.
#                     Passed through to resolve-rc-target.sh.
#   PULL_NUMBER       Prow's. Set = a pull request, which never measures a
#                     release candidate; skip.
#   ARTIFACTS         Prow's. When set, receives rc-target.env and the
#                     summary below alongside the verdict ci-eval-pr.sh writes.
#   JOB_NAME/BUILD_ID Prow's. Both set, the summary carries the run's Deck URL
#                     so the verdict is findable without a credential.
#
# NOT a whole job: the four steps stop at the verdict, and teardown is the job
# config's to run -- as a separate step, unconditionally, whatever this script
# exits with. hack/ci-teardown.sh explains what a leased project left holding a
# live install does to the next lease that gets it (#1006), and this lane
# borrows the same pool the presubmit eval does, so skipping it costs somebody
# else a run on top of whatever it cost this one.
#
# The path of this file is a CONTRACT: post-kube-agents-eval-rc in oss-test-infra
# invokes hack/ci-eval-rc.sh by name. Do not rename it.

set -euo pipefail

# The tier exported to ci-eval-pr.sh, and so which matrix this lane grades:
# `presubmit` is the merge-blocking set in eval/presubmit-cases.txt plus its
# held-out seats, `nightly` appends eval/nightly-cases.txt. Counted from those
# files rather than stated here, because both move: on 2026-09-29 they are 14
# (twelve on the roster and two held-out seats, the compliance canary, #2013,
# and pdb-remediation-pr, #2016) and 39, so 53 cases, and at three
# repetitions 42 units against 159.
#
# It is the smaller one because of the clock, not because the other cases are
# unwanted. Step 5 of staging-promotion-pipeline.yml waits 330 minutes for this
# verdict and then withdraws the nomination, and that 330 is the last of three
# ceilings: a GitHub-hosted job is killed at 360, so the waiting job is capped
# at 345 to leave itself room to write a summary. The nightly tier does not fit
# under it. ci-kube-agents-eval-nightly grades the same 126 units on the same
# pool, and in the week to 2026-09-23 its two runs that finished took 357 and
# 401 minutes while four were killed at its own 480-minute deadline.
#
# The 36-unit matrix does fit, and that is measured rather than derived. The
# presubmit runs it on the same pool at the same repetition count, so its
# fan-out is the same work this lane does: three runs that reached a verdict on
# 2026-09-24 spent 83, 110 and 143 minutes in it. Add the ~20 minutes of lease,
# build and deploy this lane pays before grading starts and the poller keeps
# real headroom under 330 even on the slow end. What that does not cover is a
# run whose cases stall rather than run: #1840's delegation block costs 45
# minutes per repetition, and enough of those exceed any budget. That failure
# is unsettled, so it withdraws the nomination and the next night asks again.
# The held-out canary (#2013) adds three repetitions serialized on its task
# lock, a ~50 minute chain at its 1002 s median and ~150 minutes if all three
# reach the 3000 s delegation ceiling, run beside the other cases; the
# held-out pdb-remediation-pr (#2016) adds three more on its own task lock, a
# ~62 minute chain at its 1250 s hint and ~96 minutes at its measured
# maximum. A graded miss on either leaves the verdict alone, since neither
# is admitted; an erroring check on either (rungs 1-3) turns the verdict RED
# like any case's.
#
# This read `nightly` from #1230 until now, under a comment saying #1175's
# switch was not on main so nothing read the export. That was true when it was
# written and false when it merged: #1175 landed 12:18 on 2026-09-05 and #1230
# 12:47, twenty-nine minutes later. The lane therefore graded the full catalog
# from its first run, unintentionally, and the timeout in oss-test-infra was
# sized for the matrix the comment described. #1620 grew the nightly roster at
# 00:07 on 2026-09-16; every run of this lane from that morning on was killed
# at its deadline. #1842 holds the measurements.
#
# Widening this back to `nightly` needs the verdict to arrive somewhere that is
# not a GitHub-hosted job holding a connection open for it. Until then the full
# catalog runs in the nightly periodic, where nothing is waiting on the clock.
