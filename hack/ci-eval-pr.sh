# Prow CI Evaluation Pipeline Script
# ==============================================================================
# Runs devops-bench evaluation against deployed platform-agent.
#
# Evaluates the task matrix in section 6 EVAL_REPETITIONS times per task and
# hands the records to `bench-gate`, which applies the rate-based gate:
# a per-case verdict ladder, a collapse rule that needs every repetition to
# fail on a case with screening evidence, and a suite aggregate. The gate is
# two-speed as before -- deterministic verification keys block, judged scores
# are recorded and gate nothing -- but the decision now lives in tested Python
# (bench/kube_agents_bench/) rather than in inline heredocs here. This script
# keeps what is genuinely shell: the loop, the repetitions, the run-directory
# diffing and the artifact handling.
#
# Why a rate and not a pass: at two hundred cases and 95% per-case
# reliability, "every case passes every run" is clean on 0.003% of runs, and a
# gate that reds seven pull requests in eight is a gate people learn to
# ignore. See bench/baselines/README.md for what admits a case.

# from the Secret the operator renders beside the door -- <agent>-a2a-inject,
# key `token` (a2aInjectName and a2aInjectTokenKey in the operator; the deploy
# already waited for it). Unset, the matrix runs over the agent API exactly
# as before. Three places read the flag: section 4 below; the baseline
# recorder (its decision, EVAL_IS_MAIN_RUN, and the log line at the record
# step after the fan-out); and the dashboard publisher's gate, which mirrors
# the recorder's. A flagged run passes neither: the next lane's periodic on
# main runs under it with no PULL_NUMBER, the shape both otherwise write

# ─── Step 0: self-revalidation against this PR's own green history (#1179) ───
# A push that changes only inert files re-runs this whole job and aborts the
# run in flight -- #1127's comment-only push cost a 123-minute re-run. Prow's
# skip_if_only_changed filter cannot help: it sees the PR's whole diff against
# the base, not the delta since the last green build. This step applies the
# same kind of path predicate to the DELTAS instead: find this PR's newest
# green build in the job history on GCS, recover that build's head and base
# SHAs, and if everything that changed since -- on the PR side AND on main's
# side -- matches the inert list, reuse the green verdict and exit 0 before
# any cluster work.
#
# FAIL-CLOSED THROUGHOUT: every doubt -- no history, unreadable GCS, an
# unparsable record, a commit the checkout does not have, any file escaping
# the inert list -- is one log line and a full run. The first run on a PR has
# no green history, so it is always a full run. EVAL_SKIP_REVALIDATION=1 is
# the escape hatch: it forces a full run for debugging a suspect reuse.
#
# One asymmetry is deliberate: the NEWEST GREEN wins, so a newer red full run
# at inert distance from an older green is overridden on the next inert
# trigger. That is the same judgement a passing /retest would render -- an
# inert delta cannot feed the eval, so the red was flake or infrastructure by
# construction -- but it does mean reproducing such a red needs either a
# non-inert push or EVAL_SKIP_REVALIDATION=1 in the job env.
#
# What it saves, honestly: the Boskos lease, ci-deploy.sh and ci-teardown.sh
# run BEFORE and AFTER this script in the Prow job wrapper, so a revalidated
# run still pays the lease + image build + deploy + teardown (~20-30min of a
# saturated pool's time), not zero -- what it skips is the eval matrix, the
# ~2h that dominates the job. Hoisting the check ahead of the lease would be
# an oss-test-infra change; this one is deliberately kube-agents-side only.
#
# Trust surface. For the SELF case, subsumption: a pull request that wants
# its own context green can already edit this script to `exit 0` -- its own
# code IS the job -- and a PR that edits the revalidation logic touches
# hack/, which is not inert, so its own run goes full. That argument does
# NOT cover the CROSS-PR case: the job history under gs://kube-agents-prow
# is written by pod utilities that may share the test container's identity,
# so a hostile PR's run could conceivably plant a fabricated "green" record
# under a VICTIM PR's history path (kube-agents-bot's review of #1186 built
# the full attack). The GCS records are therefore never trusted alone: a
# candidate green build counts only when GitHub holds a SUCCESS status
# event for this job's context on the recovered head whose target URL names
# that same build id. Statuses are posted by Prow's reporter with
# repository write permission -- google-oss-prow[bot] -- which no pull
# request holds, and the events are append-only per build (a later aborted
# run does not erase an earlier build's success event; verified against
# #1127's head 50e0f44f). The SHAs are also required to be 40-hex before
# any git command sees them, so a forged record cannot smuggle arguments.
#
# Downstream note: a revalidated run's build log carries no per-task result
# lines and no final-verdict line. scripts/eval_dashboard/collect.py already
# tolerates that shape -- aborted runs produce taskless builds today -- and
# keys nothing on this job exiting through its normal tail.

# The inert-path predicate. This list may be STRICTER than the Prow yaml's
# skip_if_only_changed (prow/prowjobs/gke-labs/kube-agents/
# kube-agents-presubmits.yaml in GoogleCloudPlatform/oss-test-infra), and it
# deliberately lives here rather than being fetched from there: the worst
# case of the two diverging is an unnecessary full run, never a wrongly
# skipped one. Keep it root-anchored -- `docs-evil.go` must not match the
# docs/ branch, `bench/OWNERS` must not match the OWNERS one, and a .md file
# below the root (agents/**/*.md is prompt content shipped in the image)
# must still run the eval.

# ─── Eval dashboard publish hook (dashboard PR 4/4) ─────────────────────────
# Re-renders and republishes the eval dashboard at the very end of every
# MAIN-BRANCH run, red or green, from the EXIT trap below. FAIL-SAFE BY
# CONTRACT: the dashboard must never break the job it observes, so every
# failure mode -- the sibling dashboard PRs not merged yet (no
# scripts/eval_dashboard/), the IAM grant not applied, a gsutil error, a
# python crash, a hung upload -- logs exactly ONE
# "eval-dashboard publish skipped: <reason>" line and never changes the job's
# exit code.
#
# MAIN-BRANCH RUNS ONLY, the baseline store's trust boundary: a presubmit
# runs branch-authored code, so publishing from one would let any pull
# request rewrite the dashboard everyone reads -- both through the bucket
# credential and through collect.py, which reads the hack/eval/ rosters and
# the domain metadata out of THIS checkout. The gate is the baseline recorder's
# (JOB_TYPE postsubmit/periodic, no PULL_NUMBER), re-derived here because the
# trap can fire from a set -e death long before that code runs. The gate
# alone is conventional -- a branch can edit this file -- which is why
# prerequisite 2 below puts the credential itself out of the presubmit's
# reach; that split is what makes the boundary structural, exactly as
# docs/designs/eval-scorer.md#the-two-service-accounts argues for the
# baseline store. The recorder's fourth condition, EVAL_MODE_NEXT unset,
# is mirrored too: the next lane's periodic reports nothing to a dashboard
# that has no lane for it yet.
#
# Nothing publishes until BOTH prerequisites exist:
#   1. the nightly periodic (NEVER the presubmit) exports
#      EVAL_DASHBOARD_TARGET (gs://kube-agents-dashboards/evals/, a dedicated
#      bucket in the team's own project) -- an oss-test-infra change;
#   2. a DEDICATED publisher identity bound to that periodic alone --
#      eval-dashboard-publisher@kube-agents-prow.iam.gserviceaccount.com via
#      Workload Identity, the eval-baseline-recorder pattern from
#      docs/designs/eval-scorer.md#provisioning-it, NEVER the shared
#      prowjob-default-sa every presubmit also runs as -- holding
#      roles/storage.objectUser on the kube-agents-dashboards bucket (a grant
#      in the team's project, not the OSS Prow infra project). Republishing
#      overwrites the same object paths, so any workable role carries
#      storage.objects.delete; the boundary is the identity, not the role:
#      no account a presubmit can run as ever holds a write on this bucket.
#      (.github/workflows/ci-health.yml publishes the same dashboard, plus
#      health.json and health-state.json, as this same publisher identity
#      reached through GitHub Actions' Workload Identity -- so "bound to
#      that periodic alone" now reads "to that periodic and that workflow",
#      still nothing a presubmit can run as.)
#      The same identity also needs READ on the sweep's source --
#      roles/storage.objectViewer on gs://kube-agents-prow -- unless that
#      bucket's existing public read already covers it; without it the first
#      armed run 403s, which the zero-runs floor below turns into a skip,
#      never into publishing an empty dashboard over a good one.
# Until both land this costs one log line per run.
# scripts/test_eval_dashboard_publish.py runs this function out of this file
# and asserts the fail-safe AND the main-branch gate hold.

# 2102186223282950144) had finished 105 and 122 units when it arrived and
# left no case JSON, no baseline line and no verdict table, because all three
# were downstream of the fan-out's `wait`; the dashboard counted each night
# 0/0/0/0 (#1491). The grading is per case now (finish_case, in the fan-out),
# so on exit every case whose last repetition finished already has its
# case-<name>.json, its `Task <name> Result:` block in this log and, on a main
# run, its baseline line; this tables those cases.
#

# counted instead of nothing. Skipped when the run reached its own suite step

# report_partial_verdict comes next, ahead of everything slow: on a deadline
# kill the grace period is five minutes and the partial table is what a
# cut-off night keeps (#1491). collect_gateway_log follows for the same reason
# collect_bench_results runs on green: a green nightly whose repetitions ran to
# the delegation ceiling used to leave no gateway log to say whether the worker
# was starved by 429s or a stuck dispatcher. collect_agent_pod_diagnostics
# follows it: a pod replaced mid-run starts a fresh gateway log, and the
# pod and event watch it stops, the previous containers and the restart
# record are what say why.
#
# `set +e` is load-bearing, not tidying. errexit stays in force inside an EXIT
# trap, so on any failing exit the `(exit "${exit_code}")` below returns
# non-zero and aborts the trap on that line -- and the dumper on the next line
# never runs. Every red eval job would lose the kubectl logs, pod descriptions
# and events that tell a transport storm from a real failure, while the
# comment above claims the exit code is handed to the dumper. Reproduce with:
#
#   bash -c 'set -e; f(){ local c=$?; (exit $c); echo reached; }; \
#            trap f EXIT; exit 7'   # never prints "reached"

# Clusters are found by label rather than by name, so this does not need to
# know the leased project's cluster prefix or region.
#
# Non-fatal by design, with one exception (the read-only credential, below,
# which a project the fleet was never applied to also lacks): an unreachable
# seeded cluster leaves its roles' files absent, and
# `fleet_resource_property` turns that into status=error naming the role and
# the project: failing the checks that needed that cluster rather than the job,
# and never silently reading platform-agent-host instead.
#
# It ran on every presubmit for weeks while every task that consumes it was
# still parked outside the matrix, and that was the point: the warnings it
# prints per project ("carries no clusters labelled environment=seeded") are
# how a pool project still needing bench/tf/fleet applied was found BEFORE
# these tasks started gating PRs rather than after. Most of the active
# tasks below read the seeded fleet -- the six domain probes, the
# cluster-debugging cases, the incident-triage probe over the same
# crashloop, the reliability variation that proposes a fix for the same
# plant, and in the nightly the full audits and the two remediation
# writers -- so those warnings have consumers.
# It costs one clusters.list, one get-credentials per seeded cluster, and
# one namespace read per probe -- seconds, against a job measured in tens
# of minutes.
#
# The `||` catches two things. Exit 3 is the read-only credential unavailable
# and ends the job (below). Any other non-zero is a REPOSITORY bug -- a missing
# or malformed bench/tf/fleet/fixtures.json, an unusable output directory --
# and warns. Every other environmental failure -- a cluster that will not
# answer, a fixture that was never planted -- returns 0 with a warning of its
# own and leaves the affected roles' files absent, which is the whole design.

# The read-only identity the role kubeconfigs should carry. It cannot be a
# static export in the Prow job the way EVAL_GITHUB_APP_ID is: the account is
# per project (`seeded-fleet-reader@<project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com`,
# bench/tf/fleet/main.tf:123) and Boskos picks the project at lease time, so
# this is the first point in the run that knows which one to name. An
# explicitly-set value still wins, for a laptop pointing at a fleet it does not
# own.
#
# The other half is the token-creator grant -- `fleet_reader_token_creators`
# in bench/tf/fleet/variables.tf, which defaults to both runners, the
# presubmit's and the nightly's, and to the CI health bot, so an apply of that
# stack grants each. A project without the binding stops the run here: the
# runner refuses to write kubeconfigs carrying this job's own read-write
# credential onto a fleet every open PR shares. A precondition, not a repair:
# the grant is `fleet_reader_token_creators`, and
# `scripts/verify_ci_pool_project.py` fails a project missing it. See
# bench/tf/fleet/README.md, "A read-only credential for evaluations".
# FLEET_ALLOW_RUNNER_CREDENTIAL=1 is a developer's opt-in for a fleet only they
# use, and a Prow job refuses it: set there it would restore the fallback.

# ─── Empty ledgers: close what an earlier run left open ──────────────────────
# A fleet-audit stream keeps one open ledger issue per audit in the leased
# project's GitOps repository, and audit_report.py `start` finds it as the
# highest open issue labelled audit:<id> -- since #1691 handing the worker
# every finding its body carries, by name. Nothing closed it between runs, so
# on a pool project every repetition of an audit case began with the ledger
# the previous lease left, already carrying the planted defect; a repetition
# could pass by keeping a carried finding rather than finding it, and a false
# clean close by repetition 2 left repetition 3 a different start than 1.
#
# hack/ci_reset_audit_ledgers.py closes those issues (a comment naming this
# build, then state closed; nothing deleted), and it is called twice: here,
# once the lease is known and before any unit, for every stream; and in
# run_one_unit, under the task lock and before devops-bench, for that unit's
# stream alone -- so repetitions 2 and 3 start as repetition 1 did, and a
# sibling lane's stream, which has its own label, is never touched. Every
# repetition then opens a fresh ledger, one closed issue per repetition in a
# repository that exists to be written to; the sibling that sweeps the
# agent's leftover pull requests is #1832's.
#
# Never any repository but the leased project's: the repository is the one
# gitops_repo_for_project() in hack/ci-deploy.sh maps for PROJECT_ID (lifted
# from that file, the mapping's one home), the helper refuses a repository
# that is not <org>/<PROJECT_ID>-infra, and the token is minted narrowed to
# that repository and issues: write -- three guards that fail independently.
# The reset token stays out of BENCH_GITHUB_TOKEN, and the grading mint asks
# for its reads explicitly (LEDGER_GRADING_MINT_BODY), so the grant the reset
# needs does not widen the token grading holds.
# A reset that cannot run (no App key, an unmapped project, a mint the
# installation refuses because App EVAL_LEDGER_APP_ID's installation no longer
# holds issues: write -- granted 2026-09-22, docs/ci-pool-projects.md 5.4)
# says so and the run goes on as it always did; it never reds a pull request.

# ─── In-flight notes: release what a dead repetition left on the sandbox ─────
# `audit_report.py start` leaves an in-flight note for its stream on the
# sandbox pod's own volume, /opt/data/scratch/inflight_<audit>.json, and
# refuses while one younger than its TTL exists; `finish` removes it. A
# repetition whose worker dies between the two -- max_turns, a pod restart,
# a dispatcher that never served the card's retry -- leaves the note, and
# inside one run the next repetition of the case starts inside that TTL
# and is refused at `start`; on a stream two cases share (the
# consistency pair, the patch pair) so is the sibling case's first
# repetition, which waits on the stream lock and starts right after. That is
# a 0/3 that reads as agent failure and was the harness's. The note is the
# run's, not the ledger's, so the ledger reset above cannot clear it; this
# does, per unit, from the same place the ledger reset runs (under the task
# lock and the stream lock, before devops-bench) and just before it, for
# that unit's stream alone. Not at lease time: the per-unit release covers a
# note an earlier lease left as well.
#
# A unit that ended on its delegation ceiling may have left a worker that is
# still running, and its note is then a live run's: removing it at once would
# start the next repetition over that worker, the overlap the note exists to
# refuse. So a note that is present is given EVAL_INFLIGHT_GRACE_SECONDS to
# be released by its own `finish` first, and removed only if it is still
# there after that; the log line says which. The wait comes BEFORE the
# ledger reset for the same stream: a `finish` that lands while the ledger is
# open rewrites it and the reset then retires it in one step, whereas a
# `finish` that lands after the reset finds no open ledger, opens a fresh one
# carrying that worker's findings, and this unit's own `start` then carries
# them -- the pre-filed ledger the per-unit reset exists to prevent.
#
# The removal runs in the sandbox pod (`kubectl exec`; the harness holds
# admin on the leased project's host cluster), pinned the way hack/ci-env.sh
# pins its log collection: to AGENT_CLUSTER_CONTEXT, the host cluster of THIS
# lease -- the task loop's tofu stacks repoint the ambient context at their
# own clusters -- and it refuses a context that does not name PROJECT_ID, an
# unset namespace, and an audit id that is not a bare label, so it cannot

# ─── The inject lane's safeguards (#2079) ────────────────────────────────────
# The cluster safeguards a case carries say nothing about GitHub, and through
# the inject door the platform persona opens a pull request where the chat
# path inlined a manifest (#2037): the first matrix run through the door left
# pull requests on the pool repository that no case had asked for.
# hack/eval/inject-lane-safeguards.yaml holds the entries every case on the
# lane carries beside its own -- one, a none-wrapped `github_writes` -- and
# this step appends them to a COPY of each task file under a scratch
# directory, `<dir>/<case>/task.yaml`, which run_one_unit hands to
# devops-bench in place of the file under bench/tasks/ (unit_task_path). The
# case id devops-bench records is the directory name, so it is unchanged;
# `bench-gate case` still reads the file under bench/tasks/, and the appended
# entry reaches it through the record's report, which is what rung 1 grades.
# The check reads the repository from BENCH_GITOPS_REPO, exported here from
# the same project mapping the deploy and the ledger reset read
# (eval_gitops_repo; EVAL_GITOPS_REPO is a local deploy's own answer), and
# refuses to start the lane without one: a lane whose safeguard cannot name
# its repository would grade every repetition as an errored check. Applied on
# the inject lane only; on the api lane the copy is never made and the file
# is never read, so that lane's matrix and task files stay byte for byte what
# they were. bench/kube_agents_bench/lane.py refuses a lane entry whose name
# a case already declares -- devops-bench would refuse the duplicate as a
# parse error on every repetition of that case, after the lease -- and
# scripts/test_eval_rosters.py pins the file's shape and the set of cases
# that request a pull request, which the fan-out runs in a phase of their
# own after every other unit (INJECT_LANE_REQUESTING, below).

# Each repetition is one unit of the parallel fan-out below, so at
# parallelism P this multiplies wall-clock by roughly 3/P, not 3; scale past
# that is issue #902's lane. The serial measurements kept below predate the
# fan-out and are its baseline.
#
# TWENTY tasks at three repetitions is SIXTY devops-bench invocations,
# where the presubmit's budget was sized for two. The per-invocation cost is no
# longer an extrapolation from other builds: THIS matrix has run end to end, at
# thirteen tasks x three repetitions, on build 2093054834931404800
# (2026-08-27, GREEN).
#
#   whole job, wall clock                                       156.8min
#     of which the 39 invocations                               140.4min
#     of which fixed (Boskos, image build 756s, deploy 913s,
#       teardown)                                                16.4min
#
# So an invocation averages 3.6min, not the 4.7min extrapolated from #956's and
# #982's builds -- those over-read it. Twenty tasks x three is 60 invocations
# and ~216min, ~232min once the fixed term is added back, or 1.55x against the
# 360m deadline.
#
# One term in that is still a substitution rather than a measurement:
# rca-remediation-pr, activated by #998 so that its own smoke run would BE the
# first measurement, is priced at the fleet average. It is one of the two active
# tasks that WRITE, so compliance-rbac-overgrant is the better comparable at a
# measured 681s per repetition -- at that cost the total is ~239min of
# invocations, ~256min with the fixed term, and 1.41x. 1.41x is the arithmetic's
# honest figure and 1.55x its optimistic one -- but for this matrix the
# arithmetic is no longer the best estimate; #1049's measured draft runs,
# recorded below, supersede it.
#
# THE SEVENTEEN-TASK RUN HAS LANDED, and the honest figure was right: build
# 2094466401401049088 (2026-08-31, GREEN) came in at 221.7min whole-job against
# the 223.2min predicted, 1.5min apart, with the optimistic 200min nowhere near.
# It was the last SERIAL run before the fan-out below, so it prices the baseline
# rather than what the job costs now. What it settles is that the 3.6min average
# and the 16.4min fixed term extrapolate honestly, which is what the four
# estimates before them did not.
#
# Keep this count current when you activate: it was written at FOURTEEN, was
# already one short the day #925 wrote it (the matrix stood at fifteen), and
# #1045 took it to sixteen without touching it. Recount the entries in
# hack/eval/presubmit-cases.txt rather than incrementing what is here.
#
# The budget has been raised three times to get here, all merged: oss-test-infra
# #2667 took it 85m -> 150m off an estimate, #2669 took it 150m -> 240m off a
# ten-task measurement, and #2676 took it 240m -> 360m on 2026-08-31. 150m would
# still have been a guaranteed timeout, which is what made #2669 a prerequisite
# rather than a follow-up.
#
# #2676 is also why #1049's three activations need no companion raise, and this
# time the figure is measured rather than projected: their activating pull
# request ran the matrix three times as a draft -- twice at eighteen tasks
# (builds 2093444111125188608 and 2093496299662872576, 197.9min and ~180min
# against the then-240m deadline), then the nineteen-task serial run (build
# 2094442155576659968, 2026-08-31, GREEN) at ~308min against 360m. ~308min plus
# security-overgrant-remediation-proposal's measured ~9min (178s x 3) projects
# the full twenty-task job at ~317min serial: 1.14x. The 3.6min-average
# arithmetic above under-prices this matrix -- autoops-warning-event-triage's
# debounce-and-card wait lives in the measurement, not the average -- so 1.14x,
# not 1.41x, is the honest figure.
#
# READ THIS BEFORE ACTIVATING ANOTHER CASE. The budget lives in another
# repository, so every activation here silently spends headroom that only a
# separate pull request can replace, and this number was invalidated FIVE times
# by a matrix that grew after it was computed (#956, then #982, then #998, then
# #1049's three) before and after real runs replaced the arithmetic. At the
# measured ~317min serial, ~43min of serial headroom remains. Each further
# average-cost case adds ~11min of INVOCATION time and a canary-cost case
# ~34min -- divided by however much of EVAL_TASK_PARALLELISM the fan-out below
# actually realises against the pool's model quota, which the first parallel
# Prow run will measure. Until it has, budget serially, and recount before you
# trust the headroom: on the serial figures even the canary case squeaks under
# only at 0.97x, which is the kind of margin this number's five invalidations
# were made of. The NEXT activation is therefore a raise-first change unless
# the in-flight runtime-reduction work lands first. Activating a case and
# raising the budget are one change in two repositories, not a change and a
# follow-up.
#
# The variance that was flagged as the thing to watch has resolved in the good
# direction: consistency-authorized-networks-probe took 1039s on the one earlier
# run that existed, against the 150-350s #956 budgeted per probe. On this matrix
# it took 699s for all THREE repetitions -- 233s each. 1039s was one bad sample,
# not its normal cost.
#
# The expensive term is instead compliance-rbac-overgrant at 2042s for three
# repetitions (681s each), which is 24% of the whole task budget on its own.
#
# 2026-09-22: incident-triage-oom-event-probe moved in from the nightly
# (#1023), the nineteenth case, measured rather than projected. Under the
# fan-out at parallelism 4 the serial arithmetic above no longer prices the
# job: the 14 green presubmits of 09-19 to 09-21 ran the fan-out in
# 6073-10940s (median 8147s) against the 360m deadline, with ~15min of build
# and deploy outside it. This case cost 737/599/1357s a repetition in its
# one presubmit run and 529-2808s on the four graded nights, so three
# repetitions add ~1800-4100s of lane time (~8-17min of wall clock at four
# lanes; up to ~35min if it runs at its nightly maximum). Hinted at 700, the
# presubmit's largest, it launches first in each repetition round, and its
# presubmit band ends well inside the shortest round-3 tail measured (first
# rep-3 launch to the fan-out's end: 2118-5849s in those 14 runs); only a
# repetition at the nightly maximum (2808s) could outlast that tail and make
# it the last unit, by minutes. No Prow deadline change rides with this
# activation. (The same pull request first moved pdb-remediation-pr in
# beside it, hinted at 1250, and withdrew that before merge: its record was
# graded by the check #1780 replaced; nightly-cases.txt carries the note.)
#
# Later on 2026-09-22 the presubmit became the BLOCKING ROSTER ONLY (#1023,
# the eval crew's call): the seven held-out cases it had been running
# without letting them block -- security-overgrant-remediation-proposal,
# #1049's three obtainability variations, rca-remediation-pr, the
# compliance-rbac-overgrant canary and cluster-agent-healthy-workload-no-
# finding -- moved to nightly-cases.txt with their hold-out reasons, and the
# arithmetic above is for a matrix that no longer runs here. TWELVE tasks,
# 36 units, against the same 360m deadline. What left: ~21 units at
# 178-1002s median a repetition (the canary's 1002s and p90 2074s the
# largest), roughly 7200-9000s of lane time, ~30-38min of wall clock at four
# lanes -- and, more to the point, the critical path. Over the 385
# presubmit runs of 09-04 to 09-15 the last unit to finish was
# obtainability-healthy-namespace-silence or obtainability-fleet-exposure-
# sweep in 81% of them (200-hinted, so launched at the tail of round 3);
# both are gone, so the tail is now one of the nine 200-hinted units still
# here, launched after incident-triage (700), capacity (540) and
# consistency (300) in each round, or the incident probe itself on a
# repetition at its nightly maximum. The span the 14 green presubmits of
# 09-19 to 09-21 measured (6073-10940s) priced the eighteen-case matrix's
# fifty-four units; the first runs of the twelve-case matrix measure the
# new one, and until they have, this note is the projection rather than the
# record. Still no Prow deadline change: the matrix shrank.
#
# 2026-09-29: the compliance canary is back in the presubmit file, held out
# (#2013 step 2): THIRTEEN tasks, 39 units, against the same 360m deadline.
# What arrived is three units at 1002s median / 2074s p90 (903 presubmit
# repetitions, 2026-09-04 to 09-15), 3000s at the delegation ceiling,
# serialized on their task lock: a ~50min chain at the median, ~104min at
# p90, ~150min if every repetition runs to the ceiling. Against the
# twelve-case fan-out that is +10-20min of wall clock in a typical run (the
# chain hides inside the span; the cost is displaced lane time) and
# +30-45min at p90, when the chain becomes the critical path. The
# dispatcher-stall residual adds ~15-20min of wait per delegation and takes
# a repetition to the ceiling only at p90. The record predates the
# collector that moves check evaluation out of the worker; the first runs
# of the thirteen-case matrix measure it, and until they have, this is the
# projection. No Prow deadline change.
#
# pdb-remediation-pr, seat opened 2026-09-28, is seated held out beside it
# (#2016 step 2): FOURTEEN tasks, 42 units, against the same 360m deadline.
# What arrived is three units of ~15-25min each (420-1153s on the four
# graded nights of 09-16 to 09-20, 980-1929s in its 2026-09-14 presubmit
# run; hinted at 1250, the presubmit's largest), serialized on their own
# task lock: a ~62min chain at the hint, ~96min if every repetition runs to
# the measured maximum, in lanes beside the canary's chain. Under the
# cost-hinted queue it launches first in each repetition round, ahead of the
# canary (1000) and the incident probe (700), so at the hint it finishes
# inside the round's tail and costs displaced lane time rather than wall
# clock; #2016 prices it the same way (three units of 15-25 min; the case
# launches early and was never the last unit in 385 recorded runs). Only a
# repetition at its 1929s maximum could be the last unit, by minutes. The
# first runs of the fourteen-case matrix measure it, and until they have,
# this is the projection. No Prow deadline change.
#
# Setting this to 1 is how the refactor gets a run directly comparable to the
# old one-run-per-task gate, and it is a legitimate thing to do by hand on a
# pull request. It is not a legitimate default: at 1 the collapse rung
# degenerates to "the single run failed", which is exactly the trigger-happy

# full-audit units -- SOP dispatch, a delegated worker sweeping the fleet,
# a ledger write, one closing line -- get 3000s.
#
# Why more than 2700 (#1683). The nightly of 2026-09-16 (build
# 2100374258805903360) cut three audits at the ceiling after their work was
# done: compliance-rbac-overgrant rep 1's worker rewrote its ledger 2520s
# after launch and the harness gave up 192s later, while the same case's
# passing rep needed 160s between its ledger write and its delivered answer;
# upgrade-readiness-lagging-cluster rep 1 timed out 30s after its ledger was
# created; fleet-cost-idle-pool rep 1 ran 2739s. The audit's own wall clock
# at p90 is ~35 minutes (2074s over 903 presubmit repetitions, 2026-09-04 to
# 09-15), so a run at p90 fits under 2700s -- the reps that hit the ceiling
# are the tail beyond it, whose true length the graded durations cannot show
# because they are cut there. The variance is still #985's problem.
#
# Why not more than 3000. The ledger read token is minted just before
# devops-bench starts (mint_ledger_token, below) and lives one hour, and
# ledger_issue_contains reads GitHub with it only after the agent turn, the
# delegation wait and the settle. The delegation clock starts after the
# opening turn, so everything outside it -- startup, port-forward, the
# opening turn, settle, the verifier's own GET -- has to fit in the hour
# minus this ceiling. 3000 leaves 600s for that; 3600 left nothing, and a
# worker that delivered its URL in the last minutes would have handed the
# verifier an expired token and a rung-2 "checks errored" red on a run that
# had done its work. 300s over 2700 covers all three cut reps above with
# margin. The task lock a later repetition waits behind is sized from this
# ceiling (run_one_unit), times the cases that share the unit's audit
# stream, so a unit that uses all of it -- after waiting its turn on the

# ─── Per-case grading and recording, inside the fan-out ─────────────────────
# A case is graded the moment its last repetition finishes, by the unit that
# finished it, not in one serial pass after the fan-out. Two reasons, both from
# the nightly (#1491):
#   - the serial pass ran off the critical path's end: 2217s over 41 cases on
#     the night of 2026-09-20 (one store read per `bench-gate case`), all of
#     it after the last unit and all of it inside the 480m budget. In the
#     lanes it overlaps units that are still running.
#   - a Prow deadline kills the fan-out before that pass. The nights of
#     2026-09-18 and 09-21 finished 105 and 122 units and recorded nothing,
#     because the case JSON, the baseline line and the verdict table were all
#     downstream of `wait`. Graded per case, everything a finished case
#     produces exists before the deadline can arrive, and the EXIT trap's
#     report_partial_verdict tables it.
# grade_case is the same grading the loop after the fan-out runs, and that loop
# still runs it for any case the fan-out did not finish: a repetition that gave
# up on its lock wrote no state, so its case never reaches the count in
# run_one_unit and is graded after the fan-out with that repetition MISSING,
# exactly as before. The `.graded` sentinel beside the state files is what

# spent two of four lanes that way for its first twelve minutes under the

#
# Two phases on the inject lane (#2079). The lane's GitHub-write safeguard
# dates a write; it cannot sign it, and every unit of the run writes to one
# repository. A case that requests a pull request (INJECT_LANE_REQUESTING,
# from the lane step; empty on the api lane and on an inject matrix with no
# such case) therefore runs only after every other unit has finished: a
# repetition of a case that requests nothing never shares the repository with
# one that writes by design, so a write inside its window is its own or a
# concurrent sibling's mistake, either of which is the red the safeguard
# exists for. The second phase runs one unit at a time, and every unit in it
# waits EVAL_GITHUB_WRITE_SETTLE_SECONDS before it starts: two requesting
# cases side by side would red each other's by-design pull requests (each
# excuses only the ones its own reply names), and the safeguard's window
# opens that many seconds before the repetition's start, so a write in the
# last seconds of the unit before -- the same case's previous repetition, or
# the first phase's last unit -- must be older than that before the next
# window can open. The cost is one drain of the lanes at the phase boundary
# and the settle plus the serial run of the requesting units (on the
# presubmit tier, one case's repetitions, which the task lock already ran one
# at a time, so three settles); the order inside each phase is unchanged.

# blocking-case list and the all-infrastructure check are both `bench-gate
# suite`'s now, computed from the per-case JSON rather than from shell state
# accumulated in the loop.

# Baseline collection, and it runs BEFORE the verdict on purpose: the suite
# step exits 1 on a red, which under `set -e` would skip everything after it.
# A red run on main is precisely the evidence that de-admits a case that has
# stopped working, so it is the one run that must not go unrecorded.
#
# Only a run on main appends: the nightly periodic today, and a postsubmit if
# one is ever added back. `bench-gate record` refuses a second time if
# PULL_NUMBER is set, because a guard that lives only in shell is one careless
# edit away from letting a pull request move the baseline it is judged against.
#
# JOB_TYPE is matched against both because the recorder moved from per-merge to
# nightly. At ~10 merges a day a postsubmit paid ~40 minutes of cluster
# provisioning for three samples of each case, and provisioning -- not the eval
# -- is what the job spends its time on. One nightly run amortises that setup
# over every repetition, so it buys a sample far cheaper and can refill the
# whole 20-run admission window in seven nights at the default three
# repetitions after a version-key bump, fewer once the count is raised on
# measured wall clock. Neither job type is a pull request, which
# is the property that actually matters here; PULL_NUMBER below is what
# enforces it. See docs/designs/eval-scorer.md#the-job-that-writes-it.
#
# With EVAL_BASELINE_STORE pointing at a bucket the append lands and the loop
# closes. Unset, the store is the git checkout and this job has no push
# credential, so the append dies with the workspace; --lines-out is what
# survives, as a Prow artefact somebody lands by hand in the meantime.
#
# RC_COMMIT_SHA is the third condition and the one that is not about pull
# requests. A release-candidate eval is a periodic with no PULL_NUMBER, so it
# satisfies the two conditions above exactly, and without this it would file the
# candidate's results as main's. That is not a mistake anybody can undo later:
# VersionKey in bench/kube_agents_bench/baselines.py is setup_id,
# scoring_version, judge_model, fleet and verifiers, with no field naming the
# build a sample came from, so an RC record and a main record are the same
# record once written. The candidate would then be measured for non-inferiority
# against a window it had just moved.
#
# EVAL_MODE_NEXT=1 is the fourth, for the same reason as the third. The next
# lane's periodic on main (ci-kube-agents-eval-next) is also a periodic with
# no PULL_NUMBER, and the key has no mode field either, so its samples would
# be today's the moment they landed. The deploy admits the flag on that job
# by name (EVAL_MODE_NEXT_JOB_NAMES in hack/ci-deploy.sh); this is what keeps
# the admission from moving the window. Whatever the job's identity may hold
# on the store is a grant in oss-test-infra this script cannot see, not a
# property of it. A next record of its own is the mode field on the key;
# until it exists a flagged run reads the store, when one is armed, and
# appends nothing.
#
# The decision itself (EVAL_IS_MAIN_RUN) and the commit stamp are taken above
# the fan-out, because record_case appends each case's line inside it as soon
# as the case is graded. This pass covers what the fan-out did not record --

# per-admitted-case coverage floor and the all-infrastructure check. Exit 0
# green, 1 red, 2 not evaluated -- an admitted case lost every repetition to
# infrastructure (or every case did), so the run cannot certify green and has
# nothing against the change to debug either. Prow reds 2 as it reds 1, which
# is right: a run that proved nothing does not merge. The distinct status and
# the `outcome` in eval-verdict.json are for the artifact and for the
# release-candidate lane, which reports NOT RUN rather than RED on them. The
# dashboard and the health bot do not read either yet: they classify this
# run from the final line's `Failed` word and from Prow's FAILURE, so until
# #1782 they still call it red; the banner in eval-verdict.md is what says
# otherwise. --baseline-rate is not passed: the rate is computed from the
# store, per admitted case at its own version key. While the store holds
# nothing, and until EVAL_AGGREGATE_ARMED is set to 1, the aggregate stays
# advisory and the markdown says so, rather than implying a comparison that
# did not happen or a rule that was armed.
