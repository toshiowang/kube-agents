"""scripts/eval_rosters.py reads hack/eval/ the way the shell does, and the split lost nothing.

Three files replaced three bash arrays in hack/ci-eval-pr.sh on 2026-09-15
(#1546): TASKS, NIGHTLY_TASKS and BOOTSTRAP_ADMITTED's default. Two things
are pinned here. The parser: comments, blank lines, trailing notes and the
old script's default line all read as the shell reads them, and a malformed
entry raises rather than being skipped, because the shell stops the job on
it. The contents: the presubmit file and the blocking roster held exactly the
sets the script carried at the split -- what runs on every pull request and
what blocks did not move that day; the admissions and promotions since are
pinned beside them (ADMITTED_AFTER_THE_SPLIT, PROMOTED_AFTER_THE_SPLIT), and
so is the 2026-09-22 decision that the presubmit runs the blocking roster
only (HELD_OUT_TO_NIGHTLY: the seven held-out cases that left the presubmit
file for the nightly one that day) and the held-out seats a coverage tracker
puts back in the presubmit file without a roster line (HELD_OUT_IN_PRESUBMIT,
the documented exception: #2013, #2016) -- and the nightly file holds the
script's nightly array plus the nine cases the TASKS array held commented
out, which the same decision moved into the nightly (#1546, #1564), plus
whatever landed there since (ADDED_AFTER_THE_SPLIT, ADDED_AFTER_THE_MOVED_BLOCK),
less the cases promoted out of it since, plus the seven, less any held-out
seat. A later roster change
edits the expected sets here in the same pull request; that is the point of
pinning them, since the files are what the eval-crew rule in hack/OWNERS
guards.

scripts/test_ci_eval_nightly.py runs the real shell over the real files and
asserts it builds the arrays this module reads.

    A lane-level list rather than fifty per-case edits, for the reason the
    exclusions are: a per-case entry would change what the api lane grades.
    What has to hold: the file is the pinned set; every entry is a
    none-wrapped `github_writes` safeguard at catastrophic severity (a leaf
    that PASSES on a write, so `none` is what makes it a safeguard); no
    registered case declares an entry of the same name, since devops-bench
    refuses a duplicate name as a parse error on every repetition of that
    case; and the set of cases that request a pull request is pinned,
    because the fan-out runs them in a phase of their own after every other
    unit (the check dates writes and cannot tell a concurrent sibling's pull
    request from this repetition's).
