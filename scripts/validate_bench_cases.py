"""Reject a broken bench case in a second instead of after a cluster lease.

A `task.yaml` mistake costs a full presubmit to discover: provision, deploy,
run the agent, score, read the log. Most of the mistakes are static. A domain
slug that matches no row in `docs/designs/domains.yaml` counts as coverage of
nothing; a fixture role the seeded fleet does not define is a case addressing
a defect that was never planted; a check with no assertion is a check that
cannot fail; a case no roster file under `hack/eval/` names never runs; a case with no
`owner:` has nobody to answer when it flakes; a fixture carrying a real
address or a credential is a leak the moment it merges. None of those needs a
cluster to find.

This module is both the library the CI lint calls
(`scripts/test_task_registration.py`) and the CLI `make bench-case-check`
runs. One implementation, and the lint asserts that `validate_all()` came back
empty rather than checking for a hand-listed set of findings, so the fast
local check and the gating lint cannot drift apart and disagree about what a
valid case is. A rule added here therefore gates the day it is written, with
no second edit anywhere. The CLI runs in no workflow; the lint is what reds a
pull request.

`docs/designs/bench-case-format.md` is the contract these rules enforce,
`docs/designs/bench-fleet-catalog.md` the fixture half of it, and
`bench/CONTRIBUTING.md` the submission path the `owner:` and sanitization rules
come from.
