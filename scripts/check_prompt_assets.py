"""Verify that the agent's instructions point at assets that exist.

The Platform Agent is steered by Markdown and one JSON file: a persona, a set
of governance SOPs, thirty-odd skill bundles, and the cron prompts that start
the autonomous watchdogs. Those documents name other files -- ``read the SOP at
'governance/compliance_audit_sop.md'``, ``run ``scripts/audit_run.py```, ``defer
to the `gke-compute-classes` skill`` -- and nothing has ever checked that the
things they name are there.

That matters more here than a broken link in a document does, because nobody is
reading these at review time. A skill renamed in one directory and cited under
its old name somewhere else compiles, lints, formats and merges clean; the cost
lands at 06:20 the next morning, inside an agent that quietly cannot find what
it was told to open and carries on without it. The failure is a *worse* answer,
not an error, so it does not page anyone -- it just makes the fleet report
slightly less true, indefinitely.

Six checks, all offline and standard library only:

``asset-path``
    Every path reference in an instruction file resolves to a real file.
``skill-ref``
    Every skill named in prose or in a cron job's ``skills`` array is a real
    skill directory with a ``SKILL.md``.
``skill-manifest``
    A ``SKILL.md``'s frontmatter ``name`` matches the directory it lives in --
    the agent loads skills by directory, so a mismatch means the prose name and
    the loadable name disagree.
``cron-asset``
    Every cron prompt sends the worker to an SOP that exists.
``cron-deliver``
    Every cron job's ``deliver`` names somewhere a message can actually go.
``cron-risk``
    Every cron job declares a risk tier (``low`` or ``high``) the runtime
    approval gate can key its command policy off.

Scope is deliberately narrow, because a lint the team switches off protects
nothing:

* only the files the *agent* reads are checked -- personas, SOPs, skills, agent
  docs and cron prompts. Plugin and directory ``README``s are developer
  documentation about Hermes internals that do not ship in the profile, and
  their relative links are already covered by ``check_docs_links.py``;
* a token is treated as a path only if it has an asset extension *and* its
  first segment names a directory that actually exists under one of the roots
  that file resolves against. That is what keeps ``roles/container.admin``,
  ``kubernetes.io/ingress.global-static-ip-name`` and the illustrative
  ``manifests/vendor/x.yaml`` out of the report without an allowlist anyone has
  to maintain;
* ``/opt/data/**`` is runtime state that exists only in a live pod, and is
  skipped. So is any reference holding a shell variable or an obvious
  placeholder;
* nothing resolves against the repository root. A checkout is not mounted into
  any agent, so ``agents/platform/skills/x/y.md`` -- which names a real file
  here, and survives every review a human gives it -- is a finding: that tree
  is COPYed to ``/opt/platform-template/skills``, so the profile home holds
  ``skills/``, never ``agents/``.

What this does *not* check is that a cron prompt's citation of its SOP's
line geography still matches the SOP. That is covered by
``test_cron_prompts_cite_the_real_sop_geography`` in
``agents/platform/skills/fleet-audit/scripts/test_audit_report.py``, which
re-derives the numbers from the SOP itself.

Findings print to stderr as ``path:line: [rule] message``, and under GitHub
Actions each one is also emitted as an ``::error`` annotation so it lands on the
offending line in the pull request's Files Changed view.
