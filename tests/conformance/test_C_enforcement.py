        allowlist does not subtract what either of them adds.

        says. Recorded here rather than repaired because #676 was deliberate:
        Workload Identity needs the metadata path, and the sidecar layout puts
        the credential proxy in the Pod that would lose it. Scoping those rules
        to the broker Pod under splitCredentialBrokerPod is the shape of the
        fix, and it is a design change to a live-tested slice, not a test edit.

        Deleting this decorator is the signal that the control works: unittest

        ON A CREDENTIAL PORT, which is the qualifier the invariant is written
        in and this assertion used to drop. `metadataServerAddresses`
        (platformagent_egress_policy.go) says it in as many words -- "on a
        credential port" and not "at all" -- because the DNS rule names
        169.254.169.254 on port 53 deliberately: under Cloud DNS for GKE that
        host is the resolver in every Pod's resolv.conf, and 53 reaches no
        token.

        Dropping the qualifier cost more than precision, because this test is
        an expected failure and a failing subTest abandons the method. The DNS
        rule is the FIRST metadata match in the fixture, so it was the recorded
        verdict and #676's rules -- the actual violation, on 80 and 988 -- were
        never evaluated. Worse, the closure route this docstring promises was
        unreachable: scope #676's rules to the broker Pod and the test would
        STILL be red on the DNS rule, so the decorator could never come off and
        the unexpected success could never fire. A permanent expected failure
        is the thing the register exists to prevent.
