	// Hermes' Docker stage2 hook generates a strong random API_SERVER_KEY into

	// that neither the operator, the Secret, the sidecar, nor the process environment had
	// ever seen. Every authenticated route 401'd — the loopback callers directly, and the
	// external path through the Service too, because the credential proxy re-signs
	// upstream with AGENT_API_UPSTREAM_KEY, which is this same sentinel. Issue #786; the

	// save_env_value refuses to write a key this file holds.
	//
	// Deliberately not a per-boot generated secret. The value is worthless — see
	// loopbackAgentAPIKey — and a generated one would have to be transported to the

// allowlist, so every globally enabled server is unioned in rather than the three named
// here. The fallback is therefore the full base bundle plus everything, on a profile

// Unlike every other profile rendering, this one is not an overlay merged into the PVC.

// /etc/hermes/config.yaml, and Hermes overlays it leaf-by-leaf on top of whichever
// config it has just loaded — see the managedScopeDir block for the full contract and
// the three enforcement points. Two earlier arrangements failed:
//
//   - subPath-mounting this rendering over $HERMES_HOME/config.yaml. A subPath is a
//     read-only mount POINT, so the agent could save nothing to its own config at all
//     (`/sethome` returned EACCES); and the entrypoint force-copied the image's config
//     over the mount anyway, so none of these keys reached a running pod.
//   - merging it into the PVC file at startup. That fixed the writability but left every
//     merged key mutable: an agent that repointed model.base_url at nothing kept that
//     across restarts, because the merge treated the runtime's edit as the newer one.
//
// THE MANAGED SCOPE IS MACHINE-GLOBAL — it is NOT the default profile's overlay.
// get_managed_dir() takes no profile argument (managed_scope.py), so every leaf below
// lands on the platform specialist and on each scaffolded cluster agent exactly as it
// lands on the front door. And a leaf REPLACES the profile's own value rather than
// merging into it — a list is a leaf too, so `platform_toolsets.cli` rendered here
// rewrote every specialist's toolset list to the front door's two-tool delegation
// surface, and `agent.disabled_toolsets` took the specialists' terminal away. Nothing
// profile-shaped may be rendered here for that reason: toolsets, disabled toolsets,
// kanban tuning, terminal cwd, mcp servers, the plugin roster and the memory provider
// are each profile's own, and stay in that profile's config.yaml in the image.
//
// WHAT BELONGS HERE is the intersection of two tests: identical for every profile in
// the pod, AND beyond the agent's own repair once broken. That is the model endpoint —
// an agent that repoints base_url at nothing cannot be told to put it back, because
// being told requires the endpoint — and the chat platform wiring that carries the
// human's only channel to it. `approvals.cron_mode` rides along as a third: it is
// uniform by design, and Hermes' own default is `deny`. Everything else is recoverable
// the way it was broken, by a human telling the agent to fix its own config, and so
// stays writable.
//
// Keys this function says nothing about stay the image's, and stay writable: that is
// what keeps `/sethome`, the monitoring install id and saved slash-command preferences
// working. `platforms.<x>.home_channel` is deliberately among them — `/sethome` writes
// it, and a leaf rendered here would overwrite the human's choice at every load.
//
// The operator's other settings for the front door are not lost, they take the other
// route: renderDefaultProfileOverlayYAML emits profile-default.overlay.yaml, which the
// entrypoint merges into the agent's own config.yaml with lists UNIONED. Anything
// operator-owned that must remain mutable — plugins.enabled above all — belongs there
// and must not be duplicated here.
// managedTerminalConfig is the `terminal` block rendered into the managed scope
// when the shell sandbox is on. The key names are Hermes' own: hermes_cli/config.py
// maps each one onto the TERMINAL_* environment variable tools/terminal_tool.py
// reads, and tools/environments/ssh.py turns them into an ssh command line.
//
// Six of these keys are Hermes'. `cwd` is absent on purpose — it is per-profile,
// and a value here would replace each profile's own (see the note on
// renderConfigYAML). `ssh_persistent` is absent because Hermes has no env var for
// it, so rendering it would look like a setting and be one only for in-process
// callers.
//
// `lifetime_seconds` is the reaper's idle timeout, and it is here to keep the
// reaper from firing at all. Nothing is reclaimed by reaping here — the far side
// is a StatefulSet pod that stays up either way — so the timeout buys nothing,
// and in upstream Hermes it costs a race: every task gets its own SSHEnvironment,
// but the ssh ControlPath is derived from sha256(user@host:port) — all three
// fixed by this block — so every concurrent task multiplexes over ONE master
// connection, and a reaped environment's cleanup() runs `ssh -O exit` on that
// shared path, killing every sibling's in-flight command with exit 255 and an
// empty stderr. At the 300s default and delegation.max_concurrent_children of 3,
// the reaper reaches that state whenever one child idles while another works.
// The agent image keys the path per environment
// (deploy/docker/patches/apply_ssh_per_env_socket.py), which closes the race for
// the reaper and for a worker process exiting alike.
//
// `workspace_root` is the sixth and is NOT Hermes'. Hermes ignores it; the reader
// is agents/platform/scripts/sandbox_exec.py, which already parses this block for
// ssh_host and needs one more fact about the far side — the directory a proxied
// command must run in, which is shellSandboxDataPath, the sandbox's data volume.
// It is published rather than hardcoded in the script because it describes
// the sandbox, and the script runs in the agent pod: the two filesystems agree
// only because deploy/sandbox/Dockerfile creates /opt/data to match, and a script
// that reads its own HERMES_HOME to name a path in another container is relying on
// that coincidence rather than on the operator that set both.

	//
	// It owns port 8643, which the Service targets, and it shares a network
	// namespace with the agent container. As an ordinary container the two started
	// in parallel and raced for the bind, and a pod where the listener lost left
	// the Service routing to nothing. Reproduced on a live cluster on 10 August,
	// when the credential runtime still ran in this container and the agent could
	// take the port deliberately by binding 0.0.0.0:8643 out of its own shell.
	// That deliberate version is gone with the shell -- code the agent runs
	// executes in the sandbox pod now -- but the startup race between two
	// containers of this pod is not, and the ordering below is what settles it.
	//
	// Note what the kubelet actually waits for: the sidecar having STARTED, plus
	// its startupProbe if it declares one. This container declares only a
	// readinessProbe, which gates pod readiness and gates nothing about app
	// container startup -- so the guarantee is ordering of process creation, not
	// "the listener has bound 8643". That is a much smaller window than two
	// containers racing from the same instant, and it is not zero. Give this
	// container a startupProbe on 8643 if the remaining window ever matters.
	//
	// This is also the ordering the pod needs for its own sake: every call into
	// the Hermes API arrives through this listener, so an agent that starts first
	// is an agent nothing can reach.
	//
	// Requires Kubernetes 1.29+. SidecarContainers is beta and on by default there;
	// it went GA in 1.33 and was alpha (off) in 1.28. 1.29 is the floor because that
	// is where restartPolicy on an init container starts being honoured without a
	// feature gate.
	//
	// On 1.28 the install fails fast rather than degrading: dropDisabledFields
	// strips restartPolicy, which leaves an ordinary init container still
	// declaring the readinessProbe buildAgentAPIAuthSidecar sets, and
	// validateInitContainers does not permit probes without restartPolicy:
	// Always. So the API server rejects the pod template and the operator's
	// apply fails -- nothing is created, nothing hangs, and there is no window
	// where the listener is running without sidecar semantics.
	// charts/kube-agents/Chart.yaml pins the same floor, so Helm refuses the
	// install before it gets that far.
	//
	// None of that applies once the credential runtime leaves this Pod, which
	// two independent switches can do. There is then no shared network namespace
	// and so no bind to race for, and what stays behind is the front door for the
	// agent's own API, which cannot follow the runtime across the Pod boundary.
	//
