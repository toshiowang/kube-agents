# 🤖 Platform Agent Operator-based GKE Deployment

This module provides a declarative, **operator-based** approach to provisioning, deploying, and managing the **Platform Agent Bot** on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Autopilot.

Instead of relying on local, imperative bash scripts to configure GCP infrastructure and Kubernetes resources, this module leverages a custom Kubernetes Controller (**`platform-agent-operator`**) and a Custom Resource Definition (**`PlatformAgent`**). The operator continuously reconciles the state of your deployment to match your desired configuration.

## 📂 Directory Structure

```bash
integrations/gchat/
├── provision.sh           # Idempotent, interactive setup to provision GKE, APIs, secrets, build agent, operator, and custom resource
└── teardown.sh            # Idempotent, interactive cleanup to tear down all GKE, operator, and GCP resources in reverse
```

_Note: The Go-based Kubernetes Operator code resides in the root [k8s-operator/](../../k8s-operator) directory._

## ⚙️ The Reconciliation Lifecycle

When you apply a `PlatformAgent` Custom Resource, the `PlatformAgentReconciler` running inside the operator automatically runs through the following steps to ensure your desired state is achieved:

1. **Finalizer Registration**: Registers `agent.platform.io/finalizer` on the CR to prevent deletion until external GCP resources are safely cleaned up.
2. **GCP Pub/Sub Provisioning**: Automatically creates the target GCP Pub/Sub Topic and Subscription for Google Chat events if they do not already exist.
3. **Identity & Access (Workload Identity)**:
   - Creates a GCP Service Account (GSA) for the bot.
   - Binds the GSA to the Kubernetes Service Account (KSA) using Workload Identity (`roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser`).
   - Binds GCP IAM role `roles/aiplatform.user` to the GSA to enable native, keyless Vertex AI/Gemini API access.
   - Grants the GSA subscriber access to the Pub/Sub subscription and publish rights for Google Chat systems on the Pub/Sub topic.
4. **Workload Deployment**: Deploys the standard Kubernetes workloads (ConfigMap `platform-agent-config`, PVC `platform-agent-data`, ServiceAccount, and the Deployment `platform-agent-gateway` container), mapping the API credentials via the local Kubernetes Secret `platform-agent-secrets` (pre-provisioned securely during setup to isolate operator permissions).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ⚡ Quickstart: Interactive Provisioner

The easiest way to get started is using the interactive `provision.sh` script. It automates GKE cluster setup, enables APIs, creates Artifact Registry, generates keys in Secret Manager, builds the agent container, builds and deploys the controller operator, and provisions a live `PlatformAgent` custom resource!

#### 1. Start the Provisioner

Run the provisioner from the `crd` directory:

```bash
cd integrations/gchat
./provision.sh
```

The script will ask you for:

- Target GCP Project ID
- Target GKE GCP Region (default: `us-central1`)
- GKE Cluster Name (default: `platform-agent-host`)
- Target Namespace (default: `agent-system`)
- Allowed Google Chat User Email

#### 2. Verify Operator & Workload Rollout

Once the script completes, check that the operator and gateway are rolling out:

```bash
kubectl get deployments -n kubeagents-system
kubectl get pods -n agent-system
```

You can track the reconciliation phase of your `PlatformAgent` custom resource:

```bash
kubectl get platformagent platform-agent-gateway -n agent-system
```

#### 3. Populate API Secrets (Optional but Recommended)

If you chose not to supply your Gemini API key during the interactive setup, you should edit the GCP Secret Manager secret `GEMINI_API_KEY` in the Google Cloud Console with your live key.

---

## 🔌 Access and Administration

### 1. Access the Local Dashboard

Port-forward the dashboard to your local machine:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n agent-system deployment/platform-agent-gateway 9119:9119
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9119` to view the Platform Agent Visual Dashboard.

### 2. Approve Google Chat Integrations

To approve a pairing code and complete Google Chat setup:

```bash
kubectl exec -it deploy/platform-agent-gateway -n agent-system -- hermes pairing approve google_chat <PAIRING_CODE>
```

---

## 🧹 Clean Up & Teardown

The `teardown.sh` script deletes the custom resource (triggering Config Connector to clean up GSA, Pub/Sub, and IAM policies), undeploys the Operator, removes KCC configurations, destroys the Secret Manager secrets, removes the Artifact Registry repository, and tears down the GKE cluster.

Run the teardown script from the `crd` directory:

```bash
cd integrations/gchat
./teardown.sh
```
