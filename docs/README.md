# Documentation map

This file is the map of the Markdown documentation in the `kube-agents`
repository: what lives where, what each document does, and which files contain
machine-generated regions. It serves human contributors and AI agents alike —
in particular, the PR docs-drift review consults it to find which documents a
code change should have updated.

The documentation **rules** — the canonical-home table ("every fact has one
home"), the generated-regions rule, link-don't-summarise, verify identifiers
against source — are owned by [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) at the repository
root. This file is the **map**, not the rulebook; read `AGENTS.md` before
editing any doc.

## 1. Directory overview

Dot-directories at the repository root (`.agents/`, `.github/`, `.claude/`)
hold tooling — review skills, PR templates, agent config — not documentation;
they are out of the map's scope and `docs-check-map` exempts them.

This file states **no document counts**, anywhere — not a repository total, not
a per-directory total, not a per-family total. A count is a number every
concurrent pull request has to edit on the same line, so a tree that grows by
two documents a week turns one shared line into a permanent merge conflict
between every branch that touches it. `docs-check-map` derives the totals it
needs from `git ls-files` at check time and prints them; nothing is restated
here for it to disagree with.

The published documentation site is built from `docs/site/src/content/docs/`
and served from GitHub Pages at <https://gke-labs.github.io/kube-agents/>
(Astro `base: '/kube-agents'`).

## 2. Canonical homes, generated regions, and identifier sources

Which file owns which category of content is defined once, in the
canonical-home table in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) — do not duplicate a fact
outside its home; link to it.

Four artifacts are **generated, not hand-written** — three regions inside
hand-written documents, plus one whole file. `scripts/generate_docs.py` (run
via `make docs-generate`) rewrites everything between the markers; everything
outside them is hand-written. Never edit inside the markers — edit the source
and regenerate.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Generated file or region | Block marker | Source of truth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/site/src/content/docs/reference/cron-jobs.md` | `<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: cron-jobs -->` | `agents/chat/defaults/cron/jobs.json` and `agents/platform/cron/jobs.json` |
| `docs/site/src/content/docs/skills/index.mdx` | `{/* BEGIN GENERATED: skill-catalog */}` (MDX comment syntax) | `name`/`description` frontmatter of every `agents/platform/skills/*/SKILL.md` and `agents/cluster/skills/*/SKILL.md` |
| `docs/site/src/content/docs/deploy/docker-images.md` | `<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: container-images -->` | `images.json` |
| `docs/family-roster.txt` | whole file (`family-roster`) | The collapsed-family globs in this map's section 4, resolved against `git ls-files` |

CI enforcement: `make docs-check` runs the same checks as
`.github/workflows/docs-check.yml` —

- `docs-check-generated` — `scripts/generate_docs.py --check`; fails if a
  generated region or file no longer matches its source. This is what catches a
  document deleted from inside a collapsed family row's glob (see section 5).
- `docs-check-links` — `scripts/check_docs_links.py`; relative links must
  resolve to **git-tracked** targets.
- `docs-check-terminology` — `hack/check-docs-terminology.sh`; identifiers in
  prose must match their source (service-account names, versions, the
  fleet-audit finding-id pattern and rendering caps, …), and a quoted cron
  prompt must be a verbatim substring of the `jobs.json` it quotes.
- `docs-check-map` — `scripts/check_docs_map.py`; every tracked `.md`/`.mdx`
  file must be matched by an inventory entry in this map (globs count), every
  path in the inventory's path column must exist, and every table row in this
  file must keep its single-space padding. Root-level dot-directories
  (`.agents/`, `.github/`, `.claude/`, …) are tooling, not docs: the map does
  not inventory them and the check does not require them — the map and the
  check share one scope. A dot-directory nested inside a documented area
  (`examples/gitops-repo/.github/`) is example content and stays in scope.

### Identifier sources

Docs state identifiers — names, defaults, versions, paths — as fact, and each
identifier has exactly one source file. Verify a doc's claim against the
source, never against another doc. The `review-docs-drift` skill classifies a
PR that touches one of these files as a change to documented identifiers and
uses this table to find what to re-verify; when a new category of documented
identifier appears, add its source here.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Identifier | Source of truth |
| --- | --- |
| Service-account names, namespace, permission-set defaults | `k8s-operator/scripts/common.sh` |
| Go toolchain version | `k8s-operator/go.mod` |
| Minimum supported tool versions (`gcloud`) | `k8s-operator/scripts/min_versions.sh` |
| Toolsets, plugins, and MCP servers of an agent profile | that profile's `config.yaml` (`agents/platform/`, `agents/chat/`, `agents/cluster/`) |
| Cron job rosters and schedules | `agents/chat/defaults/cron/jobs.json` and `agents/platform/cron/jobs.json` |
| Persona rules and `§N` section numbering | the profile's `SOUL.md` |
| RBAC bindings and KSA defaults laid down per agent | `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_manifests.go` |
| `app.kubernetes.io/*` label values on installed objects | `k8s-operator/internal/controller/manifest_helpers.go` and each `kustomization.yaml` |
| Controller permissions | `k8s-operator/config/rbac/` |
| `make` targets | the root `Makefile` and `k8s-operator/Makefile` |
| Paths baked into the agent image (`/opt/defaults/...`) | `deploy/docker/Dockerfile` |
| Image-patch module names and the behaviour they add | the module's own docstring under `deploy/docker/patches/`, plus the `COPY`/`RUN` list in `deploy/docker/Dockerfile` |
| Bundled Hermes platform plugins the image installs (no patch) | the plugin's own `adapter.py` docstring under `deploy/docker/plugins/`, plus the `COPY`/`RUN` list in `deploy/docker/Dockerfile` |
| What pod start-up force-syncs from the image vs. preserves on the PV | `deploy/shared/docker-entrypoint.sh` |
| Shared agent defaults (`approvals.*`, `security.*`) | `deploy/shared/defaults/config.yaml` and `renderConfigYAML()` in `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_manifests.go` |
| Image defaults and override env vars (`PLATFORM_AGENT_IMAGE` et al.) | `k8s-operator/internal/controller/manifest_helpers.go` |
| OTLP endpoint default, discovery candidates, and `otlpEndpointSource` values | `k8s-operator/internal/controller/telemetry.go` |
| Image inventory: every image an install pulls, and its upstream pin | `images.json` |
| Registry prefix defaults (`REGISTRY_PREFIX`, `THIRD_PARTY_REGISTRY_PREFIX`) | `k8s-operator/scripts/common.sh` |
| Provisioning image-tag attachment (`qualify_image_ref`) | `k8s-operator/scripts/common.sh` |
| GKE host-discovery label | `k8s-operator/scripts/common.sh` |

| Helm chart value defaults (KSA/secret names, image repos, tag rules) | `charts/kube-agents/values.yaml` |
| Terraform module defaults (GSA/KSA/namespace, role set, channel) | `terraform/modules/*/variables.tf` |
| Memory bank name, scope-tag spelling, and provider name | `agents/chat/plugins/memory/kube_agents_memory/config_schema.py` |
| Per-profile Hindsight recall settings the agent uses | `agents/chat/defaults/hindsight/config.json`, `agents/platform/hindsight/config.json` |
| Hindsight endpoint (`HINDSIGHT_API_URL`, derived from the namespace) | `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_manifests.go` |
| Admission webhook server port (`--webhook-port` default) | `DefaultPort` in `k8s-operator/internal/webhook/platformagent_webhook.go` |

## 3. Documentation eras and status

Not every document describes the same thing. When checking a doc against the
code, first check which era it belongs to:

- **`docs/architecture/` (01–08 + README) describes the END-STATE target, not
  what ships.** Each file carries the banner "Specifies the end state, not
  current behaviour." Do not treat mismatches between these specs and the code
  as doc bugs — the delta is the roadmap (`07-implementation-roadmap.md`).
- **The site (`docs/site/src/content/docs/`) and component READMEs describe
  what ships today** on `main`. These are the docs that must track code
  changes.
- **`docs/designs/` holds per-feature design rationale.** Status varies per
  document and is declared inline: `agent-communication.md` is a design of
  record, not yet implemented; `audit-logging-user-attribution.md` is a draft
  with an implemented/planned split per plane;
  `gchat-session-metadata-data-flow.md` documents implemented behavior.
- **Runtime assets that are NOT human docs:** `agents/platform/docs/glossary.md`
  and `agents/platform/docs/gcp-console-links.md` are baked into the agent
  image at `/opt/defaults/docs/` by `deploy/docker/Dockerfile` and are read by
  the agent at runtime. Similarly, every `SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
  `CAPABILITIES.md`, `SKILL.md`, and governance SOP under `agents/` is agent
  runtime material, copied into images or scaffolded into the pod — editing
  them changes agent behavior, not just prose. (The human-facing glossary is
  the separate site page `reference/glossary.md`.)

## 4. Inventory

One row per document; large uniform families are collapsed into a single row
whose path cell is a glob. Paths are repository-root-relative.

Two conventions keep this section mergeable, and both are load-bearing — a
document lands here from a different branch most weeks, and anything that makes
one branch rewrite another branch's bytes turns into a conflict on every open
pull request:

- **Every table is `<!-- prettier-ignore -->`d and padded with single spaces.**
  Prettier aligns Markdown table columns to the widest cell, so without the
  marker one new row re-pads every other row in the table and two PRs adding
  rows always collide. Add a row in the compact `| cell | cell |` form; never
  re-align. `docs-check-map` fails the build if a row grows a double space.
- **A family row characterises its family; it is not a roster.** Adding a skill,
  an SOP, or a reference under an existing glob needs no edit here at all — the
  glob already covers it. Edit the row only when the family's character
  changes. The per-file enumeration lives in the generated
  [`family-roster.txt`](family-roster.txt); run `make docs-generate` to refresh
  it.

### Repository root and repo meta

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Path | Category | Purpose and summary | Key topics | Audience / notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `README.md` | Project overview | Front door for "The Kubernetes Agentic Harness": Planning Agent + Platform Agent managing GKE via GitOps PRs and ChatOps, with quick-start pointers and an architecture diagram. | Value proposition, components, governance/isolation summary, links to the docs site | Evaluators and adopters; also usable by an agent to start setup |
| `INSTALL.md` | Install guide | Self-contained, executable installation guide: automated GCP/GKE provisioning, manual Kubernetes deployment, local dev, declarative Terraform+Helm install (pointer to its canonical guide), teardown, troubleshooting. Commands only; explanation lives on the site. | Prerequisites, provisioning stages, integrations, teardown | Written to be runnable end-to-end by a human or an AI agent |
| `AGENTS.md` | Contributor rules | Workspace instructions: repo layout, branching from a freshly fetched `main`, the pre-task scan of open pull requests and issues, skills guidelines, the canonical-home documentation rules, generated-regions rule, PR hygiene, the live-validation requirement, and the automated pull-request review contract. | Doc ownership table, `make docs-check`, fresh base, duplicate-work scan, Conventional Commits, fork PRs, bot review | AI coding agents and human contributors; owns the doc RULES |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Contributor rules | Imports `AGENTS.md` and adds Claude-specific commit-authorship and PR-disclosure rules. | No co-author trailers; PRs mention Claude assistance | Claude Code sessions |
| `admin_console/README.md` | Component README | Local setup and operating boundaries for the Kube Agents Console. | Connection, chat, observability, validation | Console users and contributors |
| `admin_console/CONNECTION_SECURITY.md` | Security reference | Security contract for the local console's persisted connection lease. | Stored metadata, filesystem controls, identity binding, revalidation, trust boundary | Console users and security reviewers |

### `agents/` — agent blueprints (runtime documents)

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Path | Category | Purpose and summary | Key topics | Audience / notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `agents/chat/SOUL.md` | Runtime persona | Persona of the Planning Agent — front door, planner and delegator: work out what the request needs, file it via `kanban_create` with the right specialist, relay results with attribution. Contains the planning loop, routing table, board-management rules, and red lines. | Planning/delegation, kanban board reads, attribution, no synchronous agent calls | System persona for the `default` Hermes profile; baked into the image |
| `agents/chat/AGENTS.md` | Runtime workspace | Operating doc for the Planning Agent: asynchronous delegation via the kanban board, roster discovery, red lines (plan-and-delegate-don't-do, no infrastructure tools), stateless across sessions. | Kanban delegation, injected roster, red lines | Runtime doc; baked into the image |
| `agents/chat/defaults/onboarding/*.md` | Runtime template | First-turn greeting instructions injected by the `bootstrap_onboarding` plugin: `scan_in_progress.md` (discovery still running) and `scan_completed.md` (report ready to deliver). Neither contains inventory content — the report itself is delivered verbatim by the delivery cron job. | First-run greeting, delivery expectations | Injected into the LLM turn, not shown as-is |
| `agents/chat/defaults/plugins/agent_roster/README.md` | Design doc | Why the routable-specialist roster is injected into every Chat Agent turn by a `pre_llm_call` hook instead of fetched with a `list_agents` tool call (a roundtrip cost ~6s of the ~17s acknowledgement), why the block and the MCP tool must keep rendering from the same module, and why the roster must never be cached. | Roster injection, `pre_llm_call`, fail-soft, no caching | Human design doc for contributors changing the flow |
| `agents/chat/defaults/plugins/bootstrap_onboarding/README.md` | Design doc | Design and maintenance rules of the first-run onboarding flow: the two `no_agent` cron jobs (scan gate → kanban card to `platform`; verbatim delivery), the `pre_llm_call` hook, the `/opt/data` state markers, and the load-bearing reasons the jobs must stay split and on the `default` profile. | Bootstrap flow, state markers, scheduler snapshot semantics, guardrails | Human design doc for contributors changing the flow |
| `agents/chat/defaults/plugins/legacy_slash_commands/README.md` | Design doc | Why a typed `/hermes sethome` used to draw "Unknown command `/hermes`" (Slack only routes registered slashes to the slash handler), and how the `pre_gateway_dispatch` hook unwraps the legacy `/hermes <subcommand>` form the way the Slack adapter already does for registered slashes. | Legacy slash rewrite, `pre_gateway_dispatch`, Slack manifest registration | Human design doc for contributors changing the flow |
| `agents/chat/plugins/memory/kube_agents_memory/README.md` | Component README | The default memory provider: a thin wrapper around the Hindsight plugin Hermes ships, giving one bank for everyone with a `user:<id>` or `scope:shared` tag on every fact. Covers why the wrapper exists (Hindsight cannot learn the current user's id), that the stock plugin is loaded rather than forked, and how an install selects it (`--memory=hindsight`). | Single bank, scope tags, wrapper-not-fork, provider selection | Contributors changing the provider; the design itself is `docs/designs/memory.md` |
| `agents/chat/plugins/memory/multiuser_memory/README.md` | Component README | The file-based memory provider kept as the zero-infrastructure alternative to `kube_agents_memory`: what it stores (one Markdown file per user, one shared), what it gives up (no ranking, no search, the whole store in the window every turn), and how an install selects it (`--memory=file`). | File-per-user store, provider selection, tradeoff | Contributors changing the provider; the choice itself is `docs/designs/memory.md` |
| `agents/cluster/*.md` (SOUL, AGENTS, CAPABILITIES) | Runtime persona | The Cluster Agent profile TEMPLATE personas: a read-only SRE pinned to exactly one GKE cluster — worker protocol (`kanban_show` → diagnose → `kanban_complete` with structured RCA + proposed patch metadata), read-only red lines (never mutate, never open PRs), and the routing blurb `list_agents` shows for each `cluster-*` profile. | Single-cluster diagnostics, kanban worker handoff, read-only red lines | Scaffolded into per-cluster profiles by `cluster_agent_profile.py`; force-synced from the image template on pod start |
| `agents/cluster/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Skill bundle | The Cluster Agents' single-cluster runtime-debugging bundles: `gke-observability`, `gke-reliability`, `gke-storage`, `gke-workload-scaling` (+ HPA/VPA example assets), `gke-workload-security` (+ netpol/WI assets and an audit script), `gke-workload-troubleshooting`. | Per-skill diagnostics procedures | Listed under their own persona group in the generated skill catalog |
| `agents/platform/SOUL.md` | Runtime persona | Persona of the Platform Agent ("Harness Custodian & Architect", the `platform` profile): kanban worker protocol, GitOps-only declarative changes, recovery ladder, observability guidance, incident-communication policy, deployment architecture. | Worker protocol, declarative workflow playbook, autonomy, incident triage | System persona; several docs reference its section numbers ("SOUL.md §N") |
| `agents/platform/AGENTS.md` | Runtime workspace | Workspace doc: session startup (consult the glossary), memory conventions (daily notes, `MEMORY.md`), how kanban work arrives and must be closed, red lines. | Startup, memory, kanban worker protocol | Runtime doc |
| `agents/platform/CAPABILITIES.md` | Runtime routing | One-paragraph routing blurb advertising the Platform Agent as the fleet-wide GKE architect and default specialist. | What to route to it | Consumed by the Planning Agent's roster discovery |
| `agents/platform/cron/README.md` | Component README | Editing rules for the Platform Agent's own cron store, kept beside `jobs.json` rather than inside it because `cron/jobs.py::_save_jobs_unlocked` rewrites the file to exactly `jobs` and `updated_at` and destroys any top-level comment on the first tick. Covers what actually fires this roster (`profile-cron-tick`, not the gateway thread), why no id may appear on both rosters, why no job sets `deliver: "local"` and what `deliver: "chat"` does instead, why `schedule.display` must mirror `expr`, and the two-release sequence for retiring a watchdog given that `merge_cron_store` never prunes. | Roster ownership, duplicate-id hazard, delivery targets, `--cron-retire` | Contributors editing `agents/platform/cron/jobs.json`; the tests it relies on live in the `fleet-audit` skill |
| `agents/platform/docs/glossary.md` | Runtime reference | Glossary of agentic terms (agent platforms, runtimes, Chat vs Platform agents, Hermes profiles, kanban coordination) that the agents consult at session start. | Terminology | Baked to `/opt/defaults/docs/`; NOT the human glossary (see site `reference/glossary.md`) |
| `agents/platform/docs/gcp-console-links.md` | Runtime reference | GCP Console URL templates (Logs/Trace/Metrics Explorer, GKE Workloads) that agents fill with `{project_id}` to give users clickable links. | Console deep links | Baked to `/opt/defaults/docs/` |
| `agents/platform/docs/autoops-architecture.md` | Design doc | The AutoOps extension architecture: one fixed path from an operational signal to an approved GitOps pull request, plus the five contracts (ingestion, session and state, judgment, context reach, remediation) a new operational domain implements to ride that path. Records what ships today on the GKE-events path and what a second domain has to supply. | Inject envelope and `kind`, `_build_agent_query()`, cross-domain CUJs | Human design doc; not baked into the image despite its location |
| `agents/platform/docs/session_management.md` | Design doc | Architecture of alert-to-session routing: GKE warning events flow through a stateful REST bridge into persistent diagnostic agent sessions, with SQLite schemas and troubleshooting commands. | Event dedup, chat-thread resolution, `incident_context` plugin, verification | Human design/ops doc; not baked into the image despite its location |
| `agents/platform/governance/*.md` | SOP playbook | Uniform cron-run governance playbooks, each with a purpose line and an execution checklist. The live ones are fleet audits: each emits a validated findings file and routes it through the `fleet-audit` skill, which publishes it as the stream's ledger issue. The rest are retained on disk but unscheduled — their watchdogs shipped disabled and were then retired from the cron roster. Two are first-run onboarding SOPs run by bootstrap kanban cards rather than by cron: `inventory.md` (environment discovery, writes the complete findings to `INVENTORY.raw.md`) and `inventory_prioritize_sop.md` (ranks those findings into the short `INVENTORY.md` the user is sent). | Fleet audits, drift reconciliation, cost, capacity, upgrades, first-run inventory | Runtime playbooks fired by the cron watchdogs (inventory: by the bootstrap cards); the site's governance-sops page names them and says which are live |
| `agents/platform/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Skill bundle | The Platform Agent's capability bundles, each a YAML-frontmatter (`name`, `description`) plus procedural instructions: `gke-*` skills covering cluster lifecycle and day-2 operations, the Cluster-Agent orchestration skills, self-monitoring, and GitHub issue resolution. Two are named here because they are structurally special rather than to enumerate the family: `fleet-audit` is the harness the cron audits share (one ledger issue per stream plus narrow per-finding remediation PRs), and `submit-suggestion` is the GitOps write path. The install/uninstall/upgrade lifecycle skills live in `.agents/skills/` — those skills drive the repository's own installers and are not shipped in the agent images. | Per-skill procedures | Runtime docs; enumerated by the generated skill catalog `docs/site/src/content/docs/skills/index.mdx` — frontmatter is the source of that table |
| `agents/platform/skills/*/references/*.md` | Skill reference | Cheat-sheet references across the Platform Agent skills (ComputeClass facets, autoscaler tuning, upgrade runbooks and troubleshooting, manifest recipes, AI/TPU failure signatures) loaded on demand by the skills. | Skill reference behavior | Runtime reference material |
| `agentplugins/README.md` | Component README | What an agent plugin is in this repository — a Helm chart that creates an `AgentPlugin` plus an OCI image the agent loads — the two that ship here, how they are installed and tested, and the two constraints (name pattern, target profile) that catch people adding a third. | Plugin directory overview | Anyone adding or installing a plugin |
| `agentplugins/gke-stockout-investigator/README.md` | Component README | What the stockout investigator does, how to install it, and the two behaviours that are not obvious from the chart: alerts become kanban tasks owned by the `platform` profile, and one stockout stays one investigation across autoscaler retries. | Stockout plugin install and behaviour | Operators installing or debugging the plugin |
| `agentplugins/pubsub-platform/README.md` | Component README | Installing the Pub/Sub ingress adapter, and the route keys that decide whether an alert becomes work at all: filter, threshold, dedup fields and dispatch mode. Defers to the shipped adapter reference for the message flow itself. | Alert ingress configuration | Operators configuring alert routes |
| `agentplugins/gke-stockout-investigator/files/skills/gke-stockout-investigator/SKILL.md` | Skill bundle | The GKE Stockout Investigator's procedure: judge whether a scale-up failure is real or a stale duplicate, diagnose the capacity shortfall, and propose a GitOps remediation PR. Shipped inside the plugin's OCI image and registered at load time as `gkestockoutinvestigator:gke-stockout-investigator`, so it does not appear in the generated skill catalog. | Stockout diagnosis and remediation | Runtime procedure; travels with the plugin image, not the agent image |
| `agentplugins/gke-stockout-investigator/scenarios/README.md` | Developer guide | How to trigger a stockout investigation by hand: one script per failure kind, each wedging a real workload and publishing the matching alert. Covers why a workload is needed at all, the dedup/namespace/admission constraints the harness works around, and how to add a scenario. | Manual scenario triggering | Manual demo and skill-exercise tooling; not run by CI (`verify.sh` is the smoke test) |
| `agentplugins/pubsub-platform/files/platforms/pubsub/README.md` | Plugin reference | How the Pub/Sub platform adapter routes alert notifications to agent profiles: subscription config, filtering and deduplication, and the `agent_profile` key that sends the resulting work to a specialist. | Pub/Sub alert ingress | Runtime reference; the adapter is a gateway-level singleton on the default profile |

### `docs/` — architecture, designs, and standalone documents

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Path | Category | Purpose and summary | Key topics | Audience / notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/architecture/README.md` | End-state spec | Index of the design set: authoritative build-ready spec of the end state where read-only agents replace the human interface to Kubernetes, proposing all changes through GitOps. States the core invariants. | Invariants, doc-set structure, build-from-docs instructions | "Design complete"; describes the end state, not current code |
| `docs/architecture/01-vision-scope.md` | End-state spec | North star: agents become the primary presentation layer for Kubernetes operations, serving platform / cluster-admin / developer-team audiences. | Vision, audiences, known deltas, success criteria | End-state; not current behaviour |
| `docs/architecture/02-agent-personas.md` | End-state spec | The three-persona roster (Platform, Cluster Admin, Developer Team) with shared anatomy, differing only in scope, authority, skills, and permissions. | Persona anatomy, skill allocation, ChatOps addressing, boundary matrix | End-state; only the Platform Agent exists today |
| `docs/architecture/03-security-model.md` | End-state spec | Security and trust model on five pillars: scoped identity, downward-only privilege attenuation, AI-specific defenses, declarative-only mutation, read-only human ceiling. | Threat classes, trust boundaries, per-tier RBAC, egress allowlist | End-state; not current behaviour |
| `docs/architecture/04-workflow-model.md` | End-state spec | The single change loop for all tiers: agent proposes declaratively, human approves via PR merge, customer CI/CD applies. Autonomy governs proposing, never approving. | Propose/review/reconcile, autonomy vs gates, proactivity, failure isolation | End-state; not current behaviour |
| `docs/architecture/05-system-architecture.md` | End-state spec | Whole-system assembly: hub-and-spoke topology, component inventory, data flows, shared services, NFR targets. | Components C1–C15, flows F1–F5, topology, NFRs | End-state; not current behaviour |
| `docs/architecture/06-api-and-data-contracts.md` | End-state spec | Exact interfaces to implement: tier-discriminated `Agent` CRD, pre-created read-only identity contract, GitOps repo layout, OKF schema, review-gate contract. | CR shape, cardinality, identity contract, naming conventions | End-state; the CR shape is labeled illustrative |
| `docs/architecture/07-implementation-roadmap.md` | End-state spec | Phased sequence from the current state (direct-mutation agents, `PlatformAgent` only) to the three read-only personas, with acceptance criteria per phase. | Delta table, phases, definition of done | End-state; sequencing only |
| `docs/architecture/08-agent-runtime-and-identity.md` | End-state spec | Simplest v1 runtime: a thin controller reconciles the `Agent` CRD into one isolated Hermes pod per agent bound to one pre-created read-only service account. | Runtime, identity referencing (never minting), deferred hardening | End-state; deliberately simplicity-over-defense-in-depth |
| `docs/designs/agent-communication.md` | Feature design | How the Platform Agent and per-cluster subagents exchange information: a file-based typed handover channel plus optional kanban delegation. | Blackboard model, record envelope, `write_handover` tool | Design of record; NOT yet implemented (banner in file) |

| `docs/designs/audit-logging-user-attribution.md` | Feature design | Closes the gap where audit logs identify the agent SA but not the requesting human, by carrying requester and trace/session IDs through existing telemetry. | Attribution contract per plane, correlation recipes, trust model | Draft, P0; per-plane implemented-vs-planned split declared inline |
| `docs/designs/cron-report-relay.md` | Feature design | How a scheduled job's result reaches chat with the context a follow-up question needs: the specialist reasons, hands its finished report to the Chat Agent over the Session KV server, and the Chat Agent speaks. | `deliver: "chat"`, `/v1/cron-reports`, relay turn, per-job-per-day session, `incident_context`, `report_to_chat` | Implemented; the whole Platform Agent roster delivers this way |
| `docs/designs/design_537148738.md` | Feature design | Technical design proposal for CI/CD pipeline security scanning and dependency management (Buganizer Task 537148738). | Action SHA pinning, output encapsulation, security scanning, Dependabot | Implemented (design of record) |
| `docs/designs/drift-detection.md` | Feature design | Design of record, not yet implemented. Splits drift into computing the diff (commoditized) and judging it (the differentiator); enters the shipped pipeline as a `gitops-drift` inject. | `managedFields` + audit-log attribution, revert-or-codify, CUJ selection | Status banner declares it unimplemented; no GitOps tool required |
| `docs/designs/fleet-audit-issue-ledger.md` | Feature design | Replaces the audit's PR-as-report with one ledger issue per stream plus narrow per-finding remediation PRs; hybrid auto/pull-based gating and a first-class `recommendation` field. | Ledger issue, remediation PR lifecycle, promotion gating, migration | Design of record; implemented (banner in file) |
| `docs/designs/gchat-session-metadata-data-flow.md` | Feature design | The implemented attribution path from a Google Chat message to Hermes OTel spans via the `session_store` plugin and the `session_otel_bridge`. | Session metadata allowlist, span stamping, SQLite KV store | Documents implemented behavior; site `reference/attribution.md` summarizes it |
| `docs/designs/gitops-workspace-leases.md` | Feature design | Gives every concurrent agent a private GitOps clone keyed by a lease, replacing the one shared working tree that audits and suggestions corrupted for each other. | Lease layout, `.lease` marker, reaper, credential-proxy `git` gate | Design of record; implemented (banner in file) |
| `docs/designs/inventory-findings-queue.md` | Feature design | Turns the bootstrap sweep's discarded findings into a durable `findings` table ordered by an SRE risk rubric, published whole as one rewritten-in-place backlog document, with a daily chat nudge and a prepared fix for the highest-ranked findings a pull request can be written for. | `findings` table, B/L/E/C rubric, backlog document, nudge and alarm, promotion slice, audit check-slug reuse | Design of record; NOT yet implemented (banner in file) |
| `docs/designs/memory.md` | Feature design | The memory design and the A/B that decided it: what Hermes offers, why a document store and not a flat file, which provider an install gets and where that choice is carried, the two Hindsight pods, how scope tags keep every user apart in one bank, and what the experiment measured. | Background, scaling case, provider choice, two pods, scope tags, `any_strict`, injection path, tools, experiment | Implemented on the Chat Agent profile; TTL mechanism built but deferred, returning soon; #111-#116 open |
| `docs/designs/pr-comment-conversation.md` | Feature design | How a reviewer commenting on an agent-authored pull request wakes the agent, and how the answer gets back into the thread without a state file. | Token-free cron gate, forge provider protocol, state-free idempotency markers | Design of record; §§2–6 implemented, staleness escalation designed only (banner in file) |
| `docs/designs/semver-deployment-versioning.md` | Feature design | Design rationale for adopting SemVer 2.0.0 across container images, the Helm chart, Terraform modules, release docs, and governance playbooks — decisions, shipped mechanisms, and deliberate exceptions. | OCI Helm charts, Git ref TF modules, version-injection defaults | Implemented; exceptions declared inline |
| `docs/contributing.md` | Contributor guide | Short entry point: Google CLA and community guidelines, deferring everything else to the site's contributing page and `AGENTS.md`. | CLA, pointers | Human contributors |
| `docs/credential-isolation-design.md` | Feature design | Design keeping API keys, tokens, and SA credentials out of the agent sandbox container; credentialed operations proxied through an Envoy credential-proxy sidecar. | Pod anatomy, CLI forwarding, guarantee and stated limitation | Canonical design; site `reference/credential-isolation.md` defers here |
| `docs/security-requirements.md` | Requirements | Provider-neutral security configuration model across three dimensions (permission, interaction, authorization), explicitly distinguishing current behavior from planned capabilities. | Permission sets, credential-isolation requirements, attribution requirements | Referenced by the site's security pages; current-vs-planned marked inline |
| `docs/site/README.md` | Component README | How to develop the docs site: local preview/build, layout, adding a page, CI build/deploy workflows, publishing from a fork. | `npm run dev`, frontmatter, GitHub Pages base | Site contributors |

## 5. Keeping this map fresh

- This file is **hand-maintained**. When a PR adds, moves, renames, or deletes
  a Markdown document that no existing glob covers, update the tree and the
  inventory row in the same PR. A file that lands inside a collapsed family
  needs nothing here — only `make docs-generate`, which re-snapshots the
  roster.
- **The edit a PR makes here should be the rows it actually adds — nothing
  else.** No count to bump, no column to re-align: a document-adding PR's diff
  against this file is normally a single inserted line, which is what lets two
  such PRs merge without conflicting. A diff that rewrites rows it did not
  author is a review finding, not a tidy-up.
- `make docs-check` mechanically guards **presence and shape**:
  `docs-check-map` fails CI when a tracked `.md`/`.mdx` file outside a
  root-level dot-directory has no inventory entry here, when a path in the
  inventory's path column no longer exists, or when a table row has been
  re-padded. It deliberately checks no counts — see section 1. The prose
  summaries, key-topic cells, and the identifier-sources table have no
  mechanical guard; PR review (and the drift skill) is the only check on their
  honesty.
- **A file deleted from inside a collapsed family is caught by
  [`family-roster.txt`](family-roster.txt), not by this file.** A glob keeps
  matching its survivors, so the inventory row still reads true after one of
  its documents disappears. The roster is the snapshot that notices:
  `docs-check-generated` fails until it is regenerated, and the removed path
  then appears as a deleted line in the PR diff. A PR that removes a family
  member runs `make docs-generate` and says whether the row still describes
  what is left.
- The `review-docs-drift` skill in `.agents/skills/` consults this map to find
  which docs a code change should have updated, and checks the map itself for
  staleness — keep the summaries honest. CI's docs-freshness workflow
  additionally nudges PRs that change code without touching any docs.
- The map carries **no "last verified at commit X" stamp, deliberately** — a
  stored hash is a second source of truth that goes stale the moment anything
  merges without it, and it conflicts on every concurrent PR. Git already
  records when the map was last touched; to see everything that changed since
  then, derive the delta instead of trusting a stamp:

  ```bash
  git diff --name-status "$(git log -1 --format=%H -- docs/README.md)"..HEAD -- '*.md' '*.mdx'
  ```
