# Documentation map

This file is the map of the Markdown documentation in the `kube-agents`
repository: what lives where, what each document does, and which files contain
machine-generated regions. It serves human contributors and AI agents alike —
in particular, the PR docs-drift review consults it to find which documents a
code change should have updated.

The documentation **rules** — the canonical-home table ("every fact has one
home"), the generated-regions rule, link-don't-summarise, verify identifiers
against source — are owned by [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) at the repository
root. This file is the **map**, not the rulebook; read `AGENTS.md` before
editing any doc.

## 1. Directory overview

Dot-directories at the repository root (`.agents/`, `.github/`, `.claude/`)
hold tooling — review skills, agent rules, PR templates, agent config — not
documentation; they are out of the map's scope and `docs-check-map` exempts
them. `.agents/rules/` is the one the canonical-home table in `AGENTS.md`
points at, so a rule's home is found through that table rather than through
this map. `.claude/skills` and `.claude/rules` are relative symlinks into
`.agents/`, not copies, so Claude Code reads the same files every other
harness does; [`tests/test_skill_discovery.py`](../tests/test_skill_discovery.py)
holds them to that.

This file states **no document counts**, anywhere — not a repository total, not
a per-directory total, not a per-family total. A count is a number every
concurrent pull request has to edit on the same line, so a tree that grows by
two documents a week turns one shared line into a permanent merge conflict
between every branch that touches it. `docs-check-map` derives the totals it
needs from `git ls-files` at check time and prints them; nothing is restated
here for it to disagree with.

The published documentation site is built from `docs/site/src/content/docs/`
and served from GitHub Pages at <https://gke-labs.github.io/kube-agents/>
(Astro `base: '/kube-agents'`).

## 2. Canonical homes, generated regions, and identifier sources

Which file owns which category of content is defined once, in the
canonical-home table in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) — do not duplicate a fact
outside its home; link to it.

The artifacts below are **generated, not hand-written** — regions inside
hand-written documents (a region may be spliced into several pages), plus one
whole file. `scripts/generate_docs.py` (run via `make docs-generate`) rewrites
everything between the markers; everything outside them is hand-written. Never
edit inside the markers — edit the source and regenerate.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Generated file or region | Block marker | Source of truth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/site/src/content/docs/reference/cron-jobs.md` | `<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: cron-jobs -->` | `agents/chat/defaults/cron/jobs.json` and `agents/platform/cron/jobs.json` |
| `docs/site/src/content/docs/concepts/autonomous-watchdogs.md`, `docs/site/src/content/docs/concepts/skills.md`, `docs/site/src/content/docs/reference/cron-jobs.md` | `<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: cron-job-example -->` | The `compliance-audit` entry of `agents/platform/cron/jobs.json`, rendered as fenced JSON |
| `docs/site/src/content/docs/skills/index.mdx` | `{/* BEGIN GENERATED: skill-catalog */}` (MDX comment syntax) | `name`/`description` frontmatter of every `agents/platform/skills/*/SKILL.md` and `agents/cluster/skills/*/SKILL.md` |
| `docs/site/src/content/docs/deploy/docker-images.md` | `<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: container-images -->` | `images.json` |
| `docs/family-roster.txt` | whole file (`family-roster`) | The collapsed-family globs in this map's section 4, resolved against `git ls-files` |

CI enforcement: `make docs-check` runs the same checks as
`.github/workflows/docs-check.yml` —

- `docs-check-generated` — `scripts/generate_docs.py --check`; fails if a
  generated region or file no longer matches its source. This is what catches a
  document deleted from inside a collapsed family row's glob (see section 5).
- `docs-check-links` — `scripts/check_docs_links.py`; relative links must
  resolve to **git-tracked** targets, and a `docs/designs/…` or
  `docs/architecture/…` path cited from a code or configuration file (Python,
  Go, shell, Dockerfiles, YAML, Terraform, TypeScript) must be one too.
- `docs-check-terminology` — `hack/check-docs-terminology.sh`; identifiers in
  prose must match their source (service-account names, versions, the
  fleet-audit finding-id pattern and rendering caps, …).
- `docs-check-map` — `scripts/check_docs_map.py`; every tracked `.md`/`.mdx`
  file must be matched by an inventory entry in this map (globs count), every
  path in the inventory's path column must exist, and every table row in this
  file must keep its single-space padding. Root-level dot-directories
  (`.agents/`, `.github/`, `.claude/`, …) are tooling, not docs: the map does
  not inventory them and the check does not require them — the map and the
  check share one scope. A dot-directory nested inside a documented area
  (`examples/gitops-repo/.github/`) is example content and stays in scope.
- `docs-check-audience` — `scripts/check_docs_audience.py`; no page under
  `docs/site/src/content/docs/` may match a shape in
  `scripts/docs_audience_denylist.txt` (workflow secret and variable names, App
  and installation IDs, the maintainers' Prow project, internal repositories),
  name a project ID `hack/ci-env.sh` exports (the evaluation pool), or name a
  service-account email in a non-placeholder project; it also fails when it
  finds no site page or derives no project ID. The rule is
  `.agents/rules/documentation.md`.
- `docs-check-context-budget` — `scripts/check_context_budget.py`; `AGENTS.md`
  plus `CLAUDE.md` are loaded into every agent session before the first prompt,
  and their combined size must stay inside the `BUDGET` that file sets.

### Identifier sources

Docs state identifiers — names, defaults, versions, paths — as fact, and each
identifier has exactly one source file. Verify a doc's claim against the
source, never against another doc. The `review-docs-drift` skill classifies a
PR that touches one of these files as a change to documented identifiers and
uses this table to find what to re-verify; when a new category of documented
identifier appears, add its source here.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Identifier | Source of truth |
| --- | --- |
| Kubernetes service-account names | `scripts/installer/common.sh` |
| GCP service-account names an install creates, release namespace, GKE CMEK key ring and key | `install.defaults.env` |
| Defaults an install gets for saying nothing (region, cluster, permission set, registry prefix) | `install.defaults.env` |
| Go toolchain version | `k8s-operator/go.mod` (and `a2a/go.mod`, kept in step) for building the operator; `scripts/installer/min_versions.sh` (`MIN_GO_VERSION`) for the host that imports the GitHub App key, which builds the Minty CLI and not the operator |
| The drift audit subscription's name | `subscription_name` in `terraform/modules/drift-pubsub/variables.tf`, mirrored by `defaultSubscriptionName` in `k8s-operator/cmd/drift-detector/main.go` |
| The drift batch join budget and the ack deadline it must fit inside | `defaultBatchJoinBudget`, `batchJoinBudgetCeiling` and `maxBudgetShareOfAckDeadline` in `k8s-operator/cmd/drift-detector/subscriber.go`; `ack_deadline_seconds` in `terraform/modules/drift-pubsub/variables.tf`. The detector reads the deadline at startup and warns when the budget takes more than half of it, but does not adopt it, so a doc stating one states both |
| A2A wire constants: protocol version, stream names, size thresholds, token grammar | `a2a/lib/envelope.go` and `a2a/lib/topics.go` |
| A2A subject grammar: the task subject classes (`in`, `events`, `supervisor`), their constructors and the parse that recovers addressee, taskId and class | `a2a/lib/client.go` |
| The A2A gateway process's env (backend selection, gchat relay and allowlist, display mode, addressee) | `a2a/gateway/config.go` (`FromEnv`) |
| Credential-proxy relay env vars, audiences, and route roles | reader `agents/platform/scripts/credential_proxy.py` (`serve`, `build_authenticator`, `ROUTE_ROLES`); the audience values are written by `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_broker_split.go` |
| The bus principal set: every NATS user the A2A fabric issues or renders, which are static and which authenticate through the callout, and the subject grants each one gets | `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_a2a_identities.go` (the rendered map and the surviving static users), `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_a2a_manifests.go` (the `a2a*JetStreamGrants` functions each identity's JetStream API subjects are built from) and `a2a/authcallout/session.go` (the per-session grants, which are in no map) |
| The bus token contract: the audience a bus token must carry, the path the projected volume delivers it on, and its expiry | `a2a/lib/credentials.go` (client side); `A2ABusTokenAudience` and the bus Secret names in `k8s-operator/api/v1alpha1/common_types.go` (shared by the webhook and the render); `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_a2a_callout.go` (the path and expiry the operator projects); the two sides must agree or every client is refused at connect |
| The name of the env var carrying the agent container's bus principal (`A2A_BUS_USER`) | `a2aBusUserEnv` in `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_a2a_identities.go` (writer) and `lib.EnvBusUser` in `a2a/lib/credentials.go` (reader, via `busUser()` in `a2a/cmd/a2a/main.go`); the two must agree or the CLI finds no identity, falls through to an unset `NATS_USER`, and exits `no bus identity` before it dials |
| The A2A JetStream stream limits: each stream's subjects, retention, byte cap, `max_consumers` and `max_msgs_per_subject`, including the ones derived from `spec.harness.tuning.maxSessions` | `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_a2a_manifests.go` (the rendered provision script and the constants above it); `docs/designs/spec-nats-deployment.md` argues the numbers but does not set them |
| Minimum supported tool versions (`gcloud`, `terraform`, `go`) | `scripts/installer/min_versions.sh` |
| Toolsets, plugins, and MCP servers of an agent profile | that profile's `config.yaml` (`agents/platform/`, `agents/chat/`, `agents/cluster/`) |
| Cron job rosters and schedules | `agents/chat/defaults/cron/jobs.json` and `agents/platform/cron/jobs.json` |
| Persona rules and `§N` section numbering | the profile's `SOUL.md` |
| RBAC bindings and KSA defaults laid down per agent | `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_manifests.go` |
| `app.kubernetes.io/*` label values on installed objects | `k8s-operator/internal/controller/manifest_helpers.go`, each `kustomization.yaml`, and `a2a/gateway/spawn.go` (gateway-spawned session pods) |
| The mode switch's key, values, and skew reason (`KUBEAGENTS_MODE`, `today`/`next`, `ModeNotRecognized`) | `k8s-operator/internal/controller/mode.go` and `platformagent_manifests.go` (writer), `agents/platform/scripts/runtime_mode.py` (reader) |
| Controller permissions | `k8s-operator/config/rbac/` |
| The operator RBAC self-check: the `RBACIncomplete` reason, its re-check interval and condition message; the floating tags `make deploy` refuses and `ALLOW_MUTABLE_IMG` | `k8s-operator/internal/controller/rbac_selfcheck.go`; `k8s-operator/Makefile` |
| `make` targets | the root `Makefile` and `k8s-operator/Makefile` |
| The third-party download retry rule: which files are walked and what flags a curl line must carry | `DOWNLOAD_SOURCES`, `RETRY_COUNT` and `RETRY_ALL_ERRORS` in `tests/test_third_party_download_retry.py` |
| Harness discovery of this repository's own skills: the `.claude/*` symlink targets, and the floor a lifecycle skill's description must clear | `CLAUDE_LINKS`, `LIFECYCLE_ACTIONS` and `PRODUCT` in `tests/test_skill_discovery.py` |
| The GitHub environment variables an install is configured from, which install.env key each becomes, and which are required to reconcile a long-lived environment | `MAPPING`, `REQUIRED_ALWAYS` and `REQUIRED_STRICT` in `scripts/release/render_install_env.sh` |
| Paths baked into the agent image (`/opt/defaults/...`) | `deploy/docker/Dockerfile` |
| The maintainers' CI project IDs, which `docs-check-audience` forbids on the site | `hack/ci-env.sh` (the `PROJECT_ID` export) |
| Image-patch module names and the behaviour they add | the module's own docstring under `deploy/docker/patches/`, plus the `COPY`/`RUN` list in `deploy/docker/Dockerfile` |
| Bundled Hermes platform plugins the image installs (no patch) | the plugin's own `adapter.py` docstring under `deploy/docker/plugins/`, plus the `COPY`/`RUN` list in `deploy/docker/Dockerfile` |
| Slack bot token scopes an install must grant | upstream `_build_full_manifest` in `hermes_cli/slack_cli.py` as patched by `deploy/docker/patches/apply_slack_reactions_scope.py`; the one prose copy, in `INSTALL.md`, must match it (`scripts/installer/print_instructions_slack.sh` defers to `hermes slack manifest` and carries no copy) |
| What pod start-up force-syncs from the image vs. preserves on the PV | `deploy/shared/docker-entrypoint.sh` |
| Shared agent defaults (`approvals.*`, `security.*`) | `deploy/shared/defaults/config.yaml` and `renderConfigYAML()` in `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_manifests.go` |
| Image defaults and override env vars (`PLATFORM_AGENT_IMAGE` et al.) | `k8s-operator/internal/controller/manifest_helpers.go` |
| OTLP endpoint default, discovery candidates, and `otlpEndpointSource` values | `k8s-operator/internal/controller/telemetry.go` |
| The `secret-env-hash` pod-template annotation and its re-read interval | `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_secret_hash.go` |
| DNS/metadata-daemon defaults, the `dnsClusterIPsSource` / `metadataDaemonIPSource` values, and the `additionalEgress` prefix floors (`/12`, `/48`) | `k8s-operator/internal/controller/netpolprofile.go` and `platformagent_controller.go` |
| Agent egress-allowlist policy: metadata addresses, the `-sandbox-metadata-deny` name, the `controlPlaneCIDRs` floors (`/16`, `/32`), and the `EgressAllowlistRefused` reason | `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_egress_policy.go` and `platformagent_controller.go` |
| LiteLLM egress policy: `litellm-policy`, the `enable-litellm-network-policy` and `otlp-collector-namespace` annotations, the external-endpoint port-443 check, and the `platformAgent.annotations` conflict rule | `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_litellm_policy.go`, `charts/kube-agents/templates/_helpers.tpl`, `charts/kube-agents/templates/platform-agent-cr.yaml` |
| Scoped service-account pool: `CREDENTIAL_PROXY_SCOPED_SA_POOL{,_FILE}`, the pool file path, the scope-key spelling, and the `ka-<name>-<hash8>` account ids | `agents/platform/scripts/scoped_sa_pool.py`, `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_manifests.go`, `terraform/modules/kube-agents-iam/scoped_pool.tf` |

| The gitops-state ConfigMap's keys (`managed_repos`, `context_repos`) and which one each consumer reads | `agents/platform/scripts/gitops_workspace.py` (readers), `repository_role` in `agents/platform/scripts/credential_proxy.py` (reads `context_repos` for the clone credential), and `reconcileGitopsStateConfigMap` / `syncGithubTokenMinterConfigMap` in `k8s-operator/internal/controller/platformagent_controller.go` (the `managed_repos` seed; both keys for the minter policy) |
| Chat platforms an install posts to, the order, and the fallback | `agents/platform/scripts/chat_platforms.py` |
| Which deliverables a Google Chat thread gets pasted inline, the size ceiling, and the per-message budget | `agents/platform/scripts/google_chat_relay_patch.py` |
| Staging a sandbox-written artifact out for delivery: the per-file, per-card and total ceilings, the deadline, and the denied prefixes | `agents/platform/scripts/sandbox_artifact_patch.py` |
| fleet-audit finding-id pattern and rendering caps | `agents/platform/skills/fleet-audit/scripts/audit_report.py` |
| fleet-upgrade-verification record path, file name per target, record format version, readiness flags and exit codes, kubeconfig directory and file name, and the readiness cell strings | `agents/platform/skills/fleet-upgrade-verification/scripts/fleet_upgrade_report.py` and `upgrade_readiness.py` beside it |

## 3. Documentation eras and status

Not every document describes the same thing. When checking a doc against the
code, first check which era it belongs to:

- **`docs/architecture/` (01–09 + README) describes the END-STATE target, not
  what ships.** Each file carries the banner "Specifies the end state, not
  current behaviour." Do not treat mismatches between these specs and the code
  as doc bugs — the delta is the roadmap (`07-implementation-roadmap.md`).
- **The site (`docs/site/src/content/docs/`) and component READMEs describe
  what ships today** on `main`. These are the docs that must track code
  changes.
- **`docs/designs/` holds per-feature design rationale.** Status varies per
  document and is declared inline: `agent-communication.md` is a design of
  record, not yet implemented; `audit-logging-user-attribution.md` is a draft
  with an implemented/planned split per plane;
  `gchat-session-metadata-data-flow.md` documents implemented behavior.
- **Runtime assets that are NOT human docs:** `agents/platform/docs/glossary.md`
  and `agents/platform/docs/gcp-console-links.md` are baked into the agent
  image at `/opt/defaults/docs/` by `deploy/docker/Dockerfile` and are read by
  the agent at runtime. Similarly, every `SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
  `CAPABILITIES.md`, `SKILL.md`, and governance SOP under `agents/` is agent
  runtime material, copied into images or scaffolded into the pod — editing
  them changes agent behavior, not just prose. The exception is
  `agents/contributor/AGENTS.md`, a non-runtime contributor protocol that is
  not shipped in the images. (The human-facing glossary is the separate
  site page `reference/glossary.md`.)

## 4. Inventory

One row per document; large uniform families are collapsed into a single row
whose path cell is a glob. Paths are repository-root-relative.

Two conventions keep this section mergeable, and both are load-bearing — a
document lands here from a different branch most weeks, and anything that makes
one branch rewrite another branch's bytes turns into a conflict on every open
pull request:

- **Every table is `<!-- prettier-ignore -->`d and padded with single spaces.**
  Prettier aligns Markdown table columns to the widest cell, so without the
  marker one new row re-pads every other row in the table and two PRs adding
  rows always collide. Add a row in the compact `| cell | cell |` form; never
  re-align. `docs-check-map` fails the build if a row grows a double space.
- **A family row characterises its family; it is not a roster.** Adding a skill,
  an SOP, or a reference under an existing glob needs no edit here at all — the
  glob already covers it. Edit the row only when the family's character
  changes. The per-file enumeration lives in the generated
  [`family-roster.txt`](family-roster.txt); run `make docs-generate` to refresh
  it.

### Repository root and repo meta

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Path | Category | Purpose and summary | Key topics | Audience / notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `README.md` | Project overview | Front door for "The Kubernetes Agentic Harness": Planning Agent + Platform Agent managing GKE via GitOps PRs and ChatOps, with quick-start pointers and an architecture diagram. | Value proposition, components, governance/isolation summary, links to the docs site | Evaluators and adopters; also usable by an agent to start setup |
| `INSTALL.md` | Install guide | Self-contained, executable installation guide: automated GCP/GKE provisioning, manual Kubernetes deployment, local dev, declarative Terraform+Helm install (pointer to its canonical guide), teardown, troubleshooting. Commands only; explanation lives on the site. | Prerequisites, provisioning stages, integrations, teardown | Written to be runnable end-to-end by a human or an AI agent |
| `AGENTS.md` | Contributor rules | Workspace instructions: repo layout, branching from a freshly fetched `main`, the pre-task scan of open pull requests and issues, skills guidelines, the engineering rules, the canonical-home documentation rules, generated-regions rule, PR hygiene, the live-validation requirement, and the automated pull-request review contract. States the rules; the commands that carry them out live in `docs/pull-request-workflow.md` and the mechanics that are prose in `.agents/rules/`. | Doc ownership table, engineering rules, `make docs-check`, fresh base, duplicate-work scan, Conventional Commits, fork PRs, bot review | AI coding agents and human contributors; owns the doc RULES; loaded into every session, so `make docs-check-context-budget` caps its size |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Contributor rules | Imports `AGENTS.md` and points to it for commit authorship and PR attribution guidance. | Points to `AGENTS.md` rules | Claude Code sessions |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Contributor guide | Entry point GitHub surfaces on issue and pull-request creation: the Google CLA and community guidelines, how a change is reviewed and merged, where the rules and their commands live (`AGENTS.md`, `docs/pull-request-workflow.md`, `.agents/rules/pre_pr_review.md`), and where to file issues. | CLA, pointers | Human contributors |
| `a2a/docs/hermes-bridge.md` | Feature design | The Hermes bridge, a stand-in executor for `platform`-addressed A2A tasks until the dispatcher and worker adapter land: sidecar placement via `spec.deployment.sidecars`, what that deployment method costs (the mode-flip blocker, the unscreened sidecar env), the `bridge` bus user it holds and why that stays a static password while it shares the agent's pod, the migration for an existing sidecar, task lifecycle, and the startup sweep with CAS finalization. | Sidecar placement, flip blocker, bus grants, why a token cannot separate it from the agent, sidecar migration, sweep, demolition date | Scaffolding design kept beside the `a2a/` module rather than in `docs/designs/` — it is deleted with the bridge when the dispatcher lands |
| `a2a/web/README.md` | Component README | The read-only web rail: dev tooling that watches the A2A bus from a browser as the `web` NATS user, plain ws behind `kubectl port-forward`, with the publish-refusal probe demonstrating the read-only grant live rather than asserting it. Covers the against-the-install bring-up, the 5173 origin pin, the local dev bus that mirrors the operator's render, and the live suites (`livebus`, `livesequence`). | Playground posture, port-forward transport, refusal probe, local dev bus, live suites | Contributors running or changing the rail; the web read surface itself is `spec-nats-deployment.md` |
| `admin_console/README.md` | Component README | Local setup and operating boundaries for the Kube Agents Console. | Connection, LLM gateway setup, chat, observability, integrations, validation | Console users and contributors |
| `admin_console/CONNECTION_SECURITY.md` | Security reference | Security contract for the local console's persisted connection lease. | Stored metadata, filesystem controls, identity binding, revalidation, trust boundary | Console users and security reviewers |

### `a2a/` — bus persona content (runtime documents)

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Path | Category | Purpose and summary | Key topics | Audience / notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `a2a/persona/README.md` | Component README | Why the A2A persona content lives outside the shipped persona tree: the mode switch's dark-stack promise, the three placements (binary, skill overlay, operator-rendered env), why a PVC skill copy does not survive a restart, and why the shell sandbox deliberately carries neither the client nor the credentials. | Mode-gated skill overlay, `/opt/a2a-template`, sandbox boundary | Contributors changing the A2A agent surface |
| `a2a/persona/platform/skills/a2a-topics/SKILL.md` | Skill bundle | The platform agent's topic-blackboard procedure: list/read/write durable topics on the A2A bus with provenance relayed, the honest refusals (no bus env, client absent under the shell sandbox), and what the skill is not (task status, memory, scratchpad). | Topic reads and writes, provenance, refusal paths | Runtime doc; overlaid into the profile only under `mode: next`, so it is absent from the generated skill catalog |

### `agents/` — agent blueprints (runtime documents)

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Path | Category | Purpose and summary | Key topics | Audience / notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `agents/chat/SOUL.md` | Runtime persona | Persona of the Planning Agent — front door, planner and delegator: work out what the request needs, file it via `kanban_create` with the right specialist, relay results with attribution. Contains the planning loop, routing table, board-management rules, and red lines. | Planning/delegation, kanban board reads, attribution, no synchronous agent calls | System persona for the `default` Hermes profile; baked into the image |
| `agents/chat/AGENTS.md` | Runtime workspace | Operating doc for the Planning Agent: asynchronous delegation via the kanban board, roster discovery, red lines (plan-and-delegate-don't-do, no infrastructure tools), stateless across sessions. | Kanban delegation, injected roster, red lines | Runtime doc; baked into the image |
| `agents/chat/defaults/onboarding/*.md` | Runtime template | First-turn greeting instructions injected by the `bootstrap_onboarding` plugin: `scan_in_progress.md` (discovery still running) and `scan_completed.md` (report ready to deliver). Neither contains inventory content — the report itself is delivered verbatim by the delivery cron job. | First-run greeting, delivery expectations | Injected into the LLM turn, not shown as-is |
| `agents/chat/defaults/plugins/agent_roster/README.md` | Design doc | Why the routable-specialist roster is injected into every Chat Agent turn by a `pre_llm_call` hook instead of fetched with a `list_agents` tool call (a roundtrip cost ~6s of the ~17s acknowledgement), why the block and the MCP tool must keep rendering from the same module, and why the roster must never be cached. | Roster injection, `pre_llm_call`, fail-soft, no caching | Human design doc for contributors changing the flow |
| `agents/chat/defaults/plugins/bootstrap_onboarding/README.md` | Design doc | Design and maintenance rules of the first-run onboarding flow: the two `no_agent` cron jobs (scan gate → kanban card to `platform`; verbatim delivery), the `pre_llm_call` hook, the `/opt/data` state markers, and the load-bearing reasons the jobs must stay split and on the `default` profile. | Bootstrap flow, state markers, scheduler snapshot semantics, guardrails | Human design doc for contributors changing the flow |
| `agents/chat/defaults/plugins/legacy_slash_commands/README.md` | Design doc | Why a typed `/hermes sethome` used to draw "Unknown command `/hermes`" (Slack only routes registered slashes to the slash handler), and how the `pre_gateway_dispatch` hook unwraps the legacy `/hermes <subcommand>` form the way the Slack adapter already does for registered slashes. | Legacy slash rewrite, `pre_gateway_dispatch`, Slack manifest registration | Human design doc for contributors changing the flow |
| `agents/chat/plugins/memory/kube_agents_memory/README.md` | Component README | The default memory provider: a thin wrapper around the Hindsight plugin Hermes ships, giving one bank for everyone with a `user:<id>` or `scope:shared` tag on every fact. Covers why the wrapper exists (Hindsight cannot learn the current user's id), that the stock plugin is loaded rather than forked, and how an install selects it (`--memory=hindsight`). | Single bank, scope tags, wrapper-not-fork, provider selection | Contributors changing the provider; the design itself is `docs/designs/memory.md` |
| `agents/chat/plugins/memory/multiuser_memory/README.md` | Component README | The file-based memory provider kept as the zero-infrastructure alternative to `kube_agents_memory`: what it stores (one Markdown file per user, one shared), what it gives up (no ranking, no search, the whole store in the window every turn), and how an install selects it (`--memory=file`). | File-per-user store, provider selection, tradeoff | Contributors changing the provider; the choice itself is `docs/designs/memory.md` |
| `agents/cluster/*.md` (SOUL, AGENTS, CAPABILITIES) | Runtime persona | The Cluster Agent profile TEMPLATE personas: a read-only SRE pinned to exactly one GKE cluster — worker protocol (`kanban_show` → diagnose → `kanban_complete` with structured RCA + proposed patch metadata), read-only red lines (never mutate, never open PRs), and the routing blurb `list_agents` shows for each `cluster-*` profile. | Single-cluster diagnostics, kanban worker handoff, read-only red lines | Scaffolded into per-cluster profiles by `cluster_agent_profile.py`; force-synced from the image template on pod start |
| `agents/cluster/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Skill bundle | The Cluster Agents' single-cluster runtime-debugging bundles: `gke-observability`, `gke-reliability`, `gke-stall-detection` (+ the stall report script), `gke-storage`, `gke-workload-scaling` (+ HPA/VPA example assets), `gke-workload-security` (+ netpol/WI assets and an audit script), `gke-workload-troubleshooting`. | Per-skill diagnostics procedures | Listed under their own persona group in the generated skill catalog |
| `agents/contributor/AGENTS.md` | Contributor rules | Contract for an AI agent contributing as a developer: the claim loop (assignee as the sole claim, deterministic tie-break on collision), escalating blocked work to humans via the `needs-human` label plus an `@mention`, and responding to review until the `lgtm` merge gate. Framework-agnostic: specifies GitHub state to read and write, not how to poll. | Claim protocol, `needs-human` escalation, `lgtm` merge gate | External contributor agents; referenced from the root `AGENTS.md`; not a runtime blueprint |
| `agents/platform/SOUL.md` | Runtime persona | Persona of the Platform Agent ("Harness Custodian & Architect", the `platform` profile): kanban worker protocol, GitOps-only declarative changes, recovery ladder, observability guidance, where to report a problem with kube-agents itself, incident-communication policy, deployment architecture. | Worker protocol, declarative workflow playbook, autonomy, incident triage | System persona; several docs reference its section numbers ("SOUL.md §N") |
| `agents/platform/AGENTS.md` | Runtime workspace | Workspace doc: session startup (consult the glossary), memory conventions (daily notes, `MEMORY.md`), how kanban work arrives and must be closed, red lines. | Startup, memory, kanban worker protocol | Runtime doc |
| `agents/platform/CAPABILITIES.md` | Runtime routing | One-paragraph routing blurb advertising the Platform Agent as the fleet-wide GKE architect and default specialist. | What to route to it | Consumed by the Planning Agent's roster discovery |
| `agents/platform/cron/README.md` | Component README | Editing rules for the Platform Agent's own cron store, kept beside `jobs.json` rather than inside it because `cron/jobs.py::_save_jobs_unlocked` rewrites the file to exactly `jobs` and `updated_at` and destroys any top-level comment on the first tick. Covers what actually fires this roster (`profile-cron-tick`, not the gateway thread), why no id may appear on both rosters, why exactly one job sets `deliver: "local"` and what `deliver: "chat"` does instead, why `schedule.display` must mirror `expr`, and the two-release sequence for retiring a watchdog given that `merge_cron_store` never prunes. Also the repository-side steps for adding a watchdog, how the Planning Agent's roster reaches the volume through the entrypoint, and the incidents behind the roster's rules. | Roster ownership, duplicate-id hazard, delivery targets, `--cron-retire`, entrypoint roster sync, incident history | Contributors editing `agents/platform/cron/jobs.json`; the tests it relies on live in the `fleet-audit` skill |
| `agents/platform/docs/glossary.md` | Runtime reference | Glossary of agentic terms (agent platforms, runtimes, Chat vs Platform agents, Hermes profiles, kanban coordination) that the agents consult at session start. | Terminology | Baked to `/opt/defaults/docs/`; NOT the human glossary (see site `reference/glossary.md`) |
| `agents/platform/docs/gcp-console-links.md` | Runtime reference | GCP Console URL templates (Logs/Trace/Metrics Explorer, GKE Workloads) that agents fill with `{project_id}` to give users clickable links. | Console deep links | Baked to `/opt/defaults/docs/` |
| `agents/platform/docs/autoops-architecture.md` | Design doc | The AutoOps extension architecture: one fixed path from an operational signal to an approved GitOps pull request, plus the five contracts (ingestion, session and state, judgment, context reach, remediation) a new operational domain implements to ride that path. Records what ships today on the GKE-events path and what a second domain has to supply. | Inject envelope and `kind`, `_build_agent_query()`, cross-domain CUJs | Human design doc; not baked into the image despite its location |
| `agents/platform/docs/session_management.md` | Design doc | Architecture of alert-to-session routing: GKE warning events flow through a stateful REST bridge into persistent diagnostic agent sessions, with SQLite schemas and troubleshooting commands. | Event dedup, chat-thread resolution, `incident_context` plugin, verification | Human design/ops doc; not baked into the image despite its location |
| `agents/platform/governance/*.md` | SOP playbook | Uniform cron-run governance playbooks, each with a purpose line and an execution checklist. The live ones are fleet audits: each emits a validated findings file and routes it through the `fleet-audit` skill, which publishes it as the stream's ledger issue. The rest are retained on disk but unscheduled — their watchdogs shipped disabled and were then retired from the cron roster. Three are first-run onboarding SOPs run by bootstrap kanban cards rather than by cron: `inventory.md` (environment discovery, fans the workload audit out to the Cluster Agents and aggregates what they return into `INVENTORY.raw.md`), `cluster_inventory_audit_sop.md` (the per-cluster half, run by one Cluster Agent against the cluster it is pinned to) and `inventory_prioritize_sop.md` (ranks those findings into the short `INVENTORY.md` the user is sent). The k8s-event-watcher daily recap is the one entry that documents a `no_agent` script rather than instructing an agent. | Fleet audits, drift reconciliation, cost, capacity, upgrades, first-run inventory, event-watcher recap | Runtime playbooks fired by the cron watchdogs (inventory: by the bootstrap cards; event-watcher recap: by a `no_agent` script tick); the site's governance-sops page names them and says which are live |
| `agents/platform/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Skill bundle | The Platform Agent's capability bundles, each a YAML-frontmatter (`name`, `description`) plus procedural instructions: `gke-*` skills covering cluster lifecycle and day-2 operations, the Cluster-Agent orchestration skills, self-monitoring, and GitHub issue resolution. Two are named here because they are structurally special rather than to enumerate the family: `fleet-audit` is the harness the cron audits share (one ledger issue per stream plus narrow per-finding remediation PRs), and `submit-suggestion` is the GitOps write path. The install/uninstall/upgrade lifecycle skills live in `.agents/skills/` — those skills drive the repository's own installers and are not shipped in the agent images. | Per-skill procedures | Runtime docs; enumerated by the generated skill catalog `docs/site/src/content/docs/skills/index.mdx` — frontmatter is the source of that table |
| `agents/platform/scripts/testdata/providers/*/README.md` | Reference | Provenance of the recorded forge API responses the contract harness replays, one directory per forge, kept beside the tests rather than inside the shipped package: the `{payload, responses}` file shape, why an unfixtured call raises rather than reading `None`, and the three edits made to every recording (trimmed to the read fields plus neighbours, redacted of every login and identifier, composed so a list verb has something to filter). | Fixture provenance, contract harness, redaction | Developers adding a forge or changing a translation; the harness is `agents/platform/scripts/test_providers_contract.py` |
| `agents/platform/skills/*/references/*.md` | Skill reference | Cheat-sheet references across the Platform Agent skills (ComputeClass facets, autoscaler tuning, upgrade runbooks and troubleshooting, manifest recipes, AI/TPU failure signatures, Config Connector kind catalogues) loaded on demand by the skills. | Skill reference behavior | Runtime reference material |
| `agentplugins/README.md` | Component README | What an agent plugin is in this repository — a Helm chart that creates an `AgentPlugin` plus an OCI image the agent loads — the two that ship here, how they are installed and tested, and the two constraints (name pattern, target profile) that catch people adding a third. | Plugin directory overview | Anyone adding or installing a plugin |
| `agentplugins/gke-stockout-investigator/README.md` | Component README | What the stockout investigator does, how to install it, and the two behaviours that are not obvious from the chart: alerts become kanban tasks owned by the `platform` profile, and one stockout stays one investigation across autoscaler retries. | Stockout plugin install and behaviour | Operators installing or debugging the plugin |
| `agentplugins/pubsub-platform/README.md` | Component README | Installing the Pub/Sub ingress adapter, and the route keys that decide whether an alert becomes work at all: filter, threshold, dedup fields and dispatch mode. Defers to the shipped adapter reference for the message flow itself. | Alert ingress configuration | Operators configuring alert routes |
| `agentplugins/gke-stockout-investigator/files/skills/gke-stockout-investigator/SKILL.md` | Skill bundle | The GKE Stockout Investigator's procedure: judge whether a scale-up failure is real or a stale duplicate, diagnose the capacity shortfall, and propose a GitOps remediation PR. Shipped inside the plugin's OCI image and registered at load time as `gkestockoutinvestigator:gke-stockout-investigator`, so it does not appear in the generated skill catalog. | Stockout diagnosis and remediation | Runtime procedure; travels with the plugin image, not the agent image |
| `agentplugins/gke-stockout-investigator/scenarios/README.md` | Developer guide | How to trigger a stockout investigation by hand: one script per failure kind, each wedging a real workload and publishing the matching alert. Covers why a workload is needed at all, the dedup/namespace/admission constraints the harness works around, and how to add a scenario. | Manual scenario triggering | Demo and skill-exercise tooling, also driven by the E2E suite and the RC promotion gate |
| `agentplugins/pubsub-platform/files/platforms/pubsub/README.md` | Plugin reference | How the Pub/Sub platform adapter routes alert notifications to agent profiles: subscription config, filtering and deduplication, and the `agent_profile` key that sends the resulting work to a specialist. | Pub/Sub alert ingress | Runtime reference; the adapter is a gateway-level singleton on the default profile |

### `docs/` — architecture, designs, and standalone documents

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Path | Category | Purpose and summary | Key topics | Audience / notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/architecture/README.md` | End-state spec | Index of the design set: authoritative build-ready spec of the end state where read-only agents replace the human interface to Kubernetes, proposing all changes through GitOps. States the core invariants. | Invariants, doc-set structure, build-from-docs instructions | "Design complete"; describes the end state, not current code |
| `docs/architecture/01-vision-scope.md` | End-state spec | North star: agents become the primary presentation layer for Kubernetes operations, serving platform / cluster-admin / developer-team audiences. | Vision, audiences, known deltas, success criteria | End-state; not current behaviour |
| `docs/architecture/02-agent-personas.md` | End-state spec | The three-persona roster (Platform, Cluster Admin, Developer Team) with shared anatomy, differing only in scope, authority, skills, and permissions. | Persona anatomy, skill allocation, ChatOps addressing, boundary matrix | End-state; only the Platform Agent exists today |
| `docs/architecture/03-security-model.md` | End-state spec | Security and trust model on five pillars: scoped identity, downward-only privilege attenuation, AI-specific defenses, declarative-only mutation, read-only human ceiling. | Threat classes, trust boundaries, per-tier RBAC, egress allowlist | End-state; not current behaviour |
| `docs/architecture/04-workflow-model.md` | End-state spec | The single change loop for all tiers: agent proposes declaratively, human approves via PR merge, customer CI/CD applies. Autonomy governs proposing, never approving. | Propose/review/reconcile, autonomy vs gates, proactivity, failure isolation | End-state; not current behaviour |
| `docs/architecture/05-system-architecture.md` | End-state spec | Whole-system assembly: hub-and-spoke topology, component inventory, data flows, shared services, NFR targets. | Components C1–C15, flows F1–F5, topology, NFRs | End-state; not current behaviour |
| `docs/architecture/06-api-and-data-contracts.md` | End-state spec | Exact interfaces to implement: tier-discriminated `Agent` CRD, pre-created read-only identity contract, GitOps repo layout, OKF schema, review-gate contract. | CR shape, cardinality, identity contract, naming conventions | End-state; the CR shape is labeled illustrative |
| `docs/architecture/07-implementation-roadmap.md` | End-state spec | Phased sequence from the current state (direct-mutation agents, `PlatformAgent` only) to the three read-only personas, with acceptance criteria per phase. | Delta table, phases, definition of done | End-state; sequencing only |
| `docs/architecture/08-agent-runtime-and-identity.md` | End-state spec | Simplest v1 runtime: a thin controller reconciles the `Agent` CRD into one isolated Hermes pod per agent bound to one pre-created read-only service account. | Runtime, identity referencing (never minting), deferred hardening | End-state; deliberately simplicity-over-defense-in-depth |
| `docs/architecture/09-capability-envelope.md` | End-state spec | How a request's authority travels between agents once they are separate workloads: the gateway mints a capability in NATS KV, hops attenuate by writing narrower children naming their one permitted successor, and a verification service resolves the chain. | Capability lifecycle, attenuation, delegate binding, per-hop enforcement, no cryptographic keys | Agreed design, north-star tier; presumes agents are separate workloads, so nothing in it is built yet |
| `docs/designs/agent-communication.md` | Feature design | How the Platform Agent and per-cluster subagents exchange information: a file-based typed handover channel plus optional kanban delegation. | Blackboard model, record envelope, `write_handover` tool | Design of record; NOT yet implemented (banner in file) |
| `docs/designs/agent-shell-sandboxing.md` | Feature design | The whole of #737: moves the agent's shell out of the agent pod into a per-agent sandbox StatefulSet reached over Hermes' `ssh` backend, and moves the credential proxy into a third pod of its own so no container the model can reach holds a credential or can mint the agent's GCP identity. | Terminal backend survey, Agent Sandbox vs Agent Substrate, pod-scoped Workload Identity, federation and the ID-token gap, `sync_back` write channel, gVisor/WAL blocker | Shell sandbox and the three-pod split implemented; #737 Part A (Session KV interface) not |
| `docs/designs/admin-console.md` | Feature design | Product and implementation design for the Kube Agents Console, including its shared FastAPI chat abstraction, Streamlit composition, authenticated interaction API, activity, connection, LLM gateway setup, integration status, and Kanban read models. | Admin UX, asynchronous interactions, API contract, correlation, security boundaries | Local implementation; shared proxy API and production hardening planned |
| `docs/designs/audit-logging-user-attribution.md` | Feature design | Closes the gap where audit logs identify the agent SA but not the requesting human, by carrying requester and trace/session IDs through existing telemetry. | Attribution contract per plane, correlation recipes, trust model | Draft, P0; per-plane implemented-vs-planned split declared inline |
| `docs/designs/bench-case-format.md` | Feature design | The contract for a `bench/tasks/*/task.yaml`: which fields the devops-bench loader honours and which this repository's lints do, how to choose between an exact check and a judged score, and which of the deterministic keys reds a presubmit. | `id` vs the `task_id` alias, exact-vs-judged test, the three gating keys, mandatory `domain`, `owner` and `verification_spec` | Case authors; enforced by `scripts/validate_bench_cases.py` |
| `docs/designs/bench-fleet-catalog.md` | Feature design | The case author's half of the seeded fleet: the eight fixture role slugs, why a case addresses a fixture by role and never by cluster name or project id, and which fixtures are assertable at day 0, 1, 7 and 30. | Role vocabulary, slot addressing, SOP age gates, read-only rule | Case authors; `bench/tf/fleet/README.md` is the operator's half |
| `docs/designs/capability-delivery-vehicle.md` | Requirements | What a fleet capability must provide to ship pre-defined, run on a schedule, run from chat or on an event, be tuned through an operator-aligned edit, and learn from conversations: a Scope table separating what the governance audits already have from what is new, the GitOps-backed persistence path deferred as out of scope for v1, then requirements R1–R7 — with audit and advisory capability shapes — and how each is verified on an install. | Five properties, three trigger paths, audit vs advisory, learning policy classes, three durability tiers, write-path safety | Requirements; not implemented — the Scope section names what an install already has |
| `docs/designs/cron-report-relay.md` | Feature design | How a scheduled job's result reaches chat with the context a follow-up question needs: the specialist reasons, hands its finished report to the Chat Agent over the Session KV server, and the Chat Agent speaks. | `deliver: "chat"`, `/v1/cron-reports`, relay turn, per-job-per-day session, `incident_context`, `report_to_chat` | Implemented; every report-producing job on the Platform Agent roster delivers this way, and `chat-delivery-watch` is what notices when the path is broken |
| `docs/designs/design_537148738.md` | Feature design | Technical design proposal for CI/CD pipeline security scanning and dependency management (Buganizer Task 537148738). | Action SHA pinning, output encapsulation, security scanning, Dependabot | Implemented (design of record) |
| `docs/designs/drift-detection.md` | Feature design | Design of record, partially implemented. Splits drift into computing the diff (commoditized) and judging it (the differentiator); enters the shipped pipeline as a `gitops-drift` inject. | `managedFields` + audit-log attribution, revert-or-codify, CUJ selection | Sink, audit ingestion, principal classification, the not-a-change filters and the `managedFields` join exist (`drift-pubsub`, `drift-detector`); the join fans in across the direct cluster plus every Cluster Agent profile in `--project`, and the `gitops-drift` inject ships behind `--daemon-url`; no image builds or launches the detector (banner in file) |
| `docs/designs/eval-next-transport.md` | Feature design | How a bench case reaches the agent when the install runs `spec.mode: next`: the principle (an eval is a customer's message through the front door, graded on what the customer gets back), how the port-forward and `/v1/responses` transport fails it and why the presubmit stayed green with the next stack down, stage 1 (an inject adapter in the A2A gateway, with the direct-bus transport kept as a diagnostic under its own principal), stage 2 (Chat ingress, blocked on the unrendered gateway wiring, owned by the eval crew under three conditions), completion signals with the bridge executor and kanban delegation decided, the CI flag (bridge image, sidecar, inject transport), and what is still open. | Front-door principle, inject adapter, bus diagnostic, Chat ingress, terminal instead of kanban poll, `EVAL_MODE_NEXT`, A2A owner decisions of 2026-09-17 and 2026-09-18 | Design of record; stage 1 built and off by default — the gateway door, the harness transport, the bridge image and the deploy-script flag exist, stage 2 does not (banner in file) |
| `docs/designs/eval-scorer.md` | Feature design | How the eval scorer decides and how its baseline is established, compared against and reset: the six-rung verdict ladder as built, the append-only JSONL record, the five-component version key, computed admission, the local and GCS backends, rung 6's judged comparison, the nightly job that fills the store, and how a quality-over-time dashboard reads the same data. | Six-rung ladder, append-only JSONL, version key, computed admission, `objectCreator` immutability, rung 6 margin, BigQuery external table | Design of record; partially implemented — GCS backend defaults off, bucket and dashboard do not exist (banner in file) |
| `docs/designs/fleet-anomaly-detection-checks.md` | Requirements | Candidate read-only checks a large-fleet GKE operator wants run on a schedule to surface problems confined to one cluster family or region, grouped as guardrails, usage, and costs; the Scope table maps each area to the audits that already run it and lists only the delta below. | Guardrails / usage / costs, family-aware baselines, zonal skew attribution, cost attribution | Requirements; the Scope section names which areas the existing audits already serve |
| `docs/designs/fleet-audit-collector-manifest.md` | Feature design | The JSON manifest a per-stream collector script hands `audit_report.py finish` through `--manifest-file`: its shape, which keys `finish` reads, and what each does — the per-cluster cross-check of `checks_run` and `checks_not_applicable`, collector-authored evidence, the hold on announcing a still-flagged finding resolved and its carry on the ledger body, the uncorroborated and needs-triage sets that withhold auto-promotion, the unpublished-candidate disclosure, the `unpublished_candidates`/`wholly_unpublished_checks`/`uncorroborated_findings` keys, the `--no-collector-manifest` waiver, and `AuditSpec.scopes`. | Manifest schema, cross-check rules, evidence adoption, sweep gating, waiver, per-target rosters | Design of record; `finish` side implemented, the drift and patch-readiness collectors ship (banner in file) |
| `docs/designs/fleet-audit-issue-ledger.md` | Feature design | Replaces the audit's PR-as-report with one ledger issue per stream plus narrow per-finding remediation PRs; hybrid auto/pull-based gating and a first-class `recommendation` field. | Ledger issue, remediation PR lifecycle, promotion gating, migration | Design of record; implemented (banner in file) |
| `docs/designs/gcp-api-relay.md` | Feature design | The credential broker's read-only Cloud API relay: `GET /v1/gcp/<host>/<path>` from the shell sandbox, checked against a code allowlist of Google REST reads (`api_policy.API_READ_ROUTES`) and forwarded on the broker's identity with only its own headers, so a script in the sandbox can read Cloud Monitoring without holding a Google token. Carries the live-verified facts it rests on, why the table and not the token is the enforcement, and the `ApiSession` client. | `api_policy`, `REFUSED_HOSTS`, `ApiRoute`, normal-form 400s, response cap, `ApiSession`, no IAM or operator change | Implemented; the cost collector consuming `ApiSession` is the follow-up |
| `docs/designs/gchat-session-metadata-data-flow.md` | Feature design | The implemented attribution path from a Google Chat message to Hermes OTel spans via the `session_store` plugin and the `session_otel_bridge`. | Session metadata allowlist, span stamping, SQLite KV store | Documents implemented behavior; site `reference/attribution.md` summarizes it |
| `docs/designs/gitops-workspace-leases.md` | Feature design | Gives every concurrent agent a private GitOps clone keyed by a lease, replacing the one shared working tree that audits and suggestions corrupted for each other. | Lease layout, `.lease` marker, reaper, credential-proxy `git` gate | Design of record; implemented (banner in file) |
| `docs/designs/inventory-findings-queue.md` | Feature design | Turns the bootstrap sweep's discarded findings into a durable `findings` table ordered by an SRE risk rubric, published whole as one rewritten-in-place backlog document, with a daily chat nudge and a prepared fix for the highest-ranked findings a pull request can be written for. | `findings` table, B/L/E/C rubric, backlog document, nudge and alarm, promotion slice, audit check-slug reuse | Partly implemented: §12 items 1-6 ship, 8 and 10 in part (the nudge and its change gate), 7 and 9 and 11-13 do not (banner in file) |
| `docs/designs/live-test-lease.md` | Feature design | Serializes mutating access to an installation several agents share, so two live validations cannot describe an install neither of them left behind. Covers the in-cluster ConfigMap lease, why enforcement is a hook rather than an instruction, and what counts as a mutation. | Compare-and-swap acquisition, command classification, install.env discovery, fail-to-ask | Design of record; implemented (banner in file); contributor tooling, not shipped to installs |
| `docs/designs/memory.md` | Feature design | The memory design and the A/B that decided it: what Hermes offers, why a document store and not a flat file, which provider an install gets and where that choice is carried, the two Hindsight pods, how scope tags keep every user apart in one bank, and what the experiment measured. | Background, scaling case, provider choice, two pods, scope tags, `any_strict`, injection path, tools, experiment | Implemented on the Chat Agent profile; TTL mechanism built but deferred, returning soon; #111-#116 open |
| `docs/designs/multi-project-scope.md` | Feature design | Why the Platform Agent manages one GCP project today (one `clusters list`, one project of IAM bindings, "1 per project" in the architecture) and the opt-in scope that replaces it: explicit projects, folders, and organisations on `spec.scope`, resolved through Cloud Asset Inventory, granted by container-level IAM so a new project under a declared folder onboards with no change, with a per-project outcome snapshot so a denied project reads as a finding rather than an empty fleet. | `spec.scope`, Asset Inventory resolution, folder-level IAM inheritance, `fleet_scope.json`, single-project assumptions inventory, sequencing | Design of record; phases 1 and 2 mechanisms (explicit projects; folders and organisations) implemented; their IAM and installer pieces, phase 1's chart-render and MCP-server pieces, and later phases pending |
| `docs/designs/pr-comment-conversation.md` | Feature design | How a reviewer commenting on an agent-authored pull request wakes the agent, and how the answer gets back into the thread without a state file. | Token-free cron gate, forge provider protocol, state-free idempotency markers | Design of record; §§2–6 implemented, staleness escalation designed only (banner in file) |
| `docs/designs/retrospective.md` | Feature design | A daily job that reads an install's Cloud Logging and Cloud Trace records, finds work its agents repeated or wasted, and proposes a memory fact, capability criterion or reviewed skill that an operator accepts or dismisses outside chat; Hermes' own skill review is switched off in its favour. | Harness-neutral task records, deterministic detectors, recurrence gate, ConfigMap ledger, human decision record, a fixed route per detector, facts tagged by domain | Proposed; not implemented |
| `docs/designs/semver-deployment-versioning.md` | Feature design | Design rationale for adopting SemVer 2.0.0 across container images, the Helm chart, Terraform modules, release docs, and governance playbooks — decisions, shipped mechanisms, and deliberate exceptions. | OCI Helm charts, Git ref TF modules, version-injection defaults | Implemented; exceptions declared inline |
| `docs/designs/e2e-testing-harness.md` | Feature design | Architecture, execution model, and scenario matrix of the multi-stage E2E testing harness, RC promotion gates, and nightly matrix. | E2E stages, fleet audit probes, stockout scenarios, live chat | Design of record; implemented (banner in file) |
| `docs/designs/testing-strategy.md` | Feature design | What "tested" means for an autonomous actor with standing authority in a production fleet, and the tiers that answer it: unit, integration (real seams, fake agent), presubmit evals, the release gate, and the nightly (the E2E pipeline and the eval periodic), plus the visibility layer that makes a verdict readable. Carries the domain-coverage rule, the six-rung eval gate ladder, the statistical treatment of judged scores, and the eval-driven-development flow with its expected-fail marker. | Tiers, domain as unit of coverage, 3 repetitions per case, non-inferiority against `main`'s baseline, pinned judge and pinned scorer, keep writing new cases | **Draft**, in review; §4.2's statistical gate is advisory until the evidence store holds `main`'s window. Unit tests are real and the integration tier gates; the seeded fleet is applied and standing; presubmit runs the full case matrix and has blocked merges since 2026-09-02; the release-candidate eval reports and gates nothing (§4.3); the nightly eval periodic is scheduled and the E2E nightly pipeline runs daily (§4.4) |
| `docs/designs/spec-a2a-payloads.md` | Feature design | Wire protocol for agent-to-agent messaging over NATS JetStream (`a2a-jetstream/0.4`): the envelope, the A2A payload layering rule, the three addressee-scoped task subject classes (`in`, `events`, `supervisor`), subject-derived verified identity and the per-class agreement checks it turns on, the task lifecycle mapped onto streams, the topic namespace, and the conformance assertions the client library must pass. | Envelope, layering rule, addressee token, supervisor subject, verified identity, permanently-null `identity`, advisory `authority`, steering, topics, conformance assertions | Stage 1 client library and conformance suite implemented in `a2a/` |
| `docs/designs/spec-chatops-gateway.md` | Feature design | The chat-to-bus gateway: deterministic code with no model of its own, owning sessions (one backend conversation, one `contextId`), requester identity onto the bus as an advisory `authority` block, the group-chat substrate, Discord as the test backend, with an inject side door for the evals, and the Google Chat adapter as the production ingress. | Session model, `authority` block, roster snapshots, `openDirect`, session lifecycle, gchat adapter | Merged design of record; the gateway program is implemented (`a2a/gateway`) with Discord and Google Chat adapters, and the operator renders it, its env and the session-spawn arming (`A2A_SPAWN_SESSIONS=true`) under `mode: next`, but not yet the gchat adapter's env |
| `docs/designs/spec-mode-switch.md` | Feature design | The single dev-mode toggle (`spec.mode`, `today`/`next`) that keeps the A2A stack dark: one optional CRD enum read through one nil-safe fail-closed helper, Degraded with a named reason on version skew, not surfaced in the Helm chart until graduation. | `renderMode` helper, `KUBEAGENTS_MODE`, per-feature override sketch | Merged design of record; the switch, the NATS/gateway render it gates, the agent bus surface and the session-spawn arming are all implemented |
| `docs/designs/spec-nats-deployment.md` | Feature design | The NATS deployment for the A2A fabric: stream and retention layout, connection-time authorization via auth callout, the audit model (the stream is the buffer and replay window, the log sink is the archive), and the client resilience contract as testable requirements. | Streams, accounts, deny-by-default users, the auth callout and claim narrowing, audit exporter, restart conformance assertion | Merged design of record; the operator renders it under `mode: next`. Connection-time authorization is no longer the playground's gap: the callout is armed and session pods get per-pod grants. What is still playground is the exporter, and the gateway, `bridge` and `seed` users that remain static passwords — `bridge` permanently, since a sidecar shares its pod's ServiceAccount and a token would key it to the agent's map entry |
| `docs/designs/spec-subagent-profiles.md` | Feature design | Subagents as declarative profiles: the `AgentProfile` resource, submission as a bus message rather than an API call, dispatcher-rendered Jobs, four reserved artifact names, the janitor for orphaned tasks, and the kanban retirement inventory with its two named gaps. | `AgentProfile`, dispatcher, artifact names, lifecycle, kanban gap table | Profile schema and strict loader implemented in `a2a/profiles`; the CRD and dispatcher are not |
| `docs/designs/upgrade-readiness-checks.md` | Requirements | Candidate read-only checks a large-fleet GKE operator wants run on a schedule ahead of a Kubernetes minor-version bump — GKE deprecation insights joined to their callers, add-on compatibility, drain safety, and a per-family Go / No-Go verdict; the Scope table maps each area to the audits and skills that already run it and lists only the delta below. | Deprecation insights, drain safety, per-family verdict | Requirements; the Scope section names what `security-patch-orchestrator`, `obtainability-audit` and `fleet-upgrade-verification` already serve |
| `docs/designs/version-control-support.md` | Feature design | The single design for driving a version-control forge that is not GitHub: the layers that name GitHub today, a broker that owns every remote verb, one real git in the sandbox holding no origins and no credentials, forges behind a neutral provider interface one directory each, the credential as one object the forge chooses plus a per-clone read-only one on request, and GitLab as the worked example. Carries the A/B/C experiment that chose the shape, why an MCP server is an addition rather than the mechanism, and the honest limits. | Broker verbs, `Forge` interface, `Credential` strategy, `Transport` protocol, `providers/` layout, `AVAILABLE`/`for_config`, import-boundary test, the experiment | Design of record; the broker seam, `providers/` with GitHub, the `version-control` skill and the sandbox git are on `main`; consumer migration, `spec.integration.git` and GitLab are not (banner in file) |
| `docs/ci-health.md` | Contributor guide | The presubmit-gate health adjudicator: what GREEN / DEGRADED / OUTAGE mean, the rule and incident behind each, the hysteresis, the replay over history, and how the Google Chat posting is configured. | `health.py`, `post_health.py`, `ci-health.yml`, shared break, quota storm, delegation ceiling, setup deaths, lost pods, deadline kills, fixture drift, Chat app setup | Anyone reading a `#kube-agents-ci-health` message; the constants live in `scripts/eval_dashboard/health.py` |
| `docs/ci-pool-projects.md` | Maintainer runbook | Onboarding a GCP project into the Prow Boskos evaluation pool: enabled APIs, host cluster, IAM, the AR cleanup policy, the per-project GitHub token minter, the ledger read credential, the seeded fleet, pre-flight verification, Boskos registration, concurrency, and when to onboard the next one. Names the GitHub App IDs, the Prow runner and the key's location by the constants in `scripts/provision_ci_pool_project.sh` and `scripts/verify_ci_pool_project.py` rather than printing them. | Pool prerequisites, `verify_ci_pool_project.py`, `pool_pressure.py` | Maintainers; not user-facing, which is why it is not on the site |
| `docs/credential-isolation-design.md` | Feature design | Design keeping API keys, tokens, and SA credentials out of the agent sandbox; credentialed operations proxied through an Envoy credential broker in a Pod of its own. | Pod anatomy, CLI forwarding, guarantee and stated limitation | Canonical design; site `reference/credential-isolation.md` defers here |
| `docs/eval-gate-roster.md` | Contributor guide | The prose behind the blocking roster in `hack/eval/blocking-roster.txt` (`BOOTSTRAP_ADMITTED`): what admits an eval case, which cases are held out and on which issue, the rung scoping of that promise, the same-day demotion protocol, the `EVAL_ADMISSION_MODE` rule (the roster decides, the record informs), and what the record must show before switching to `record`. Moved out of the script so roster-prose edits stop costing eval runs (#1179). | Blocking roster, admission bar, hold-out exits, rung 4-only demotion lever, admission mode, record verdict | AI coding agents and human contributors; the list itself lives in `hack/eval/blocking-roster.txt`, this page is the prose |
| `docs/environment-reconcile.md` | Maintainer runbook | Keeping the long-lived `autopush` and `staging` environments in step with the composition rather than only re-tagging their images: the scheduled drift report, the atomic deploys, the rebuild button, the GitHub variables and secrets each environment must carry, and what a rebuild does not preserve. | Drift report, `reconcile-environment.yml`, required per-environment variables, rebuild | Maintainers; not user-facing, which is why it is not on the site |
| `docs/pull-request-workflow.md` | Contributor guide | The commands behind `AGENTS.md`'s pull-request rules: the duplicate-work scan, the branch-drift check against `upstream/main`, the local validation checks and the constraint each one exists for, and the `kube-agents-bot` review — how long it takes, how to poll for it, how to reply and resolve. Ends at the merge: the two labels Tide requires, the `OWNERS` approvers behind them, `/hold`, why branch protection reads as though there is no review gate, what a re-run of a flaked check records, and which party owes an open pull request its next move. | `gh` and GraphQL recipes, drift `comm` check, prettier/shellcheck/Docker/layer-budget detail, bot timing and failure modes, Tide `lgtm`+`approved`, `OWNERS`, PR ownership rule, `ci:flaky` re-run issues | AI coding agents and human contributors; mechanics only, `AGENTS.md` owns the rules |
| `docs/testing-map.md` | Contributor guide | The mechanics behind `AGENTS.md`'s rule for where a test goes: the eleven test homes, what runs each, and how far "runs on a pull request" is from "gates a merge" — three paths-filtered workflows that report green having run nothing, a release gate on a three-hourly schedule rather than manual dispatch, and a directory no `PYTHON_TEST_DIRS` glob reaches. | Test-tier routing, `make test-python`/`test-bench`/`verify`, `dorny/paths-filter` green-on-nothing, RC pipeline schedule, test discovery globs | AI coding agents and human contributors; mechanics only, `AGENTS.md` owns the rule |
| `docs/security-requirements.md` | Requirements | Provider-neutral security configuration model across three dimensions (permission, interaction, authorization), explicitly distinguishing current behavior from planned capabilities. | Permission sets, credential-isolation requirements, attribution requirements | Referenced by the site's security pages; current-vs-planned marked inline |
| `docs/chatops/microsoft-teams.md` | Integration guide | Deployment, Azure Entra ID / Bot Framework app registration, single-tenant policy lockdown, and Microsoft Teams ChatOps configuration walkthrough. | Microsoft Teams, Bot Framework, Entra ID OAuth, App manifest, Adaptive Cards | Administrators enabling Microsoft Teams ChatOps |
| `docs/site/README.md` | Component README | How to develop the docs site: local preview/build, layout, adding a page, CI build/deploy workflows, publishing from a fork. | `npm run dev`, frontmatter, GitHub Pages base | Site contributors |

## 5. Keeping this map fresh

- This file is **hand-maintained**. When a PR adds, moves, renames, or deletes
  a Markdown document that no existing glob covers, update the tree and the
  inventory row in the same PR. A file that lands inside a collapsed family
  needs nothing here — only `make docs-generate`, which re-snapshots the
  roster.
- **The edit a PR makes here should be the rows it actually adds — nothing
  else.** No count to bump, no column to re-align: a document-adding PR's diff
  against this file is normally a single inserted line, which is what lets two
  such PRs merge without conflicting. A diff that rewrites rows it did not
  author is a review finding, not a tidy-up.
- `make docs-check` mechanically guards **presence and shape**:
  `docs-check-map` fails CI when a tracked `.md`/`.mdx` file outside a
  root-level dot-directory has no inventory entry here, when a path in the
  inventory's path column no longer exists, when a table row has been
  re-padded, or when a published-site row's audience cell names maintainers,
  CI engineers, or contributors; a map with no published-site table is an
  error, not a pass. It deliberately checks no counts — see
  section 1. The prose
  summaries, key-topic cells, and the identifier-sources table have no
  mechanical guard; PR review (and the drift skill) is the only check on their
  honesty.
- **A site row's audience cell may not name maintainers, CI engineers, or
  contributors.** The site is for people installing and operating kube-agents
  on their own clusters; a page for anyone else belongs under one of the other
  homes the canonical-home table in `AGENTS.md` names (maintainer environments,
  release runbooks, the evaluation pool), typed as it is there, with its row in
  that section of this map. `docs-check-map` rejects the words, with the CLA
  page `contributing.md` as the one exemption; `docs-check-audience` rejects
  the identifiers such a page carries.
- **A file deleted from inside a collapsed family is caught by
  [`family-roster.txt`](family-roster.txt), not by this file.** A glob keeps
  matching its survivors, so the inventory row still reads true after one of
  its documents disappears. The roster is the snapshot that notices:
  `docs-check-generated` fails until it is regenerated, and the removed path
  then appears as a deleted line in the PR diff. A PR that removes a family
  member runs `make docs-generate` and says whether the row still describes
  what is left.
- The `review-docs-drift` skill in `.agents/skills/` consults this map to find
  which docs a code change should have updated, and checks the map itself for
  staleness — keep the summaries honest. CI's docs-freshness workflow
  additionally nudges PRs that change code without touching any docs.
- The map carries **no "last verified at commit X" stamp, deliberately** — a
  stored hash is a second source of truth that goes stale the moment anything
  merges without it, and it conflicts on every concurrent PR. Git already
  records when the map was last touched; to see everything that changed since
  then, derive the delta instead of trusting a stamp:

  ```bash
  git diff --name-status "$(git log -1 --format=%H -- docs/README.md)"..HEAD -- '*.md' '*.mdx'
  ```
