title: Cron jobs
description: The two shipped cron rosters — the Planning Agent's plumbing and the Platform Agent's governance watchdogs.

Two files define the scheduled jobs, one per profile, and which one an entry belongs in follows from what runs it. For the story of what these jobs achieve together, see [Proactive autonomy](/kube-agents/overview/proactive-autonomy/); for the mechanism, [What fires the schedule](/kube-agents/concepts/autonomous-watchdogs/#what-fires-the-schedule).

`agents/chat/defaults/cron/jobs.json` is the Planning Agent's roster, and the only store the gateway's own ticker advances — unless the experimental [`platformFrontDoor`](/kube-agents/operator/platformagent-crd/#platformfrontdoor) flag has re-homed the gateway, which moves the ticked store to the Platform Agent's roster and stops this one. Every entry on it is a `no_agent` **script** job — a plain subprocess, no model prompted — because that profile's toolsets are stripped to `mcp-router`, `kanban` and `memory` and it could not run an audit if asked. Four jobs ship: `profile-cron-tick`, the every-minute dispatcher that ticks every named profile with work due; the hourly `cluster-agent-reconcile` sweep that keeps [Cluster Agent](/kube-agents/concepts/cluster-agents/) profiles aligned with the live fleet; and the two [first-run onboarding](/kube-agents/concepts/chatops/#first-run-onboarding) jobs, `bootstrap-inventory-scan` and `bootstrap-inventory-delivery`.

`agents/platform/cron/jobs.json` is the Platform Agent's roster, and carries the nine governance watchdogs plus the `no_agent` entries that run no model: `github-repo-watcher`, the daily recap described below, the findings-queue morning nudge, the kanban workspace collector, `kanban-board-health`, which names any kanban card blocked past a day in chat, with the commands to move it, `chat-delivery-watch`, which notices when scheduled reports stop reaching chat and says so on a GitHub ledger issue and in Cloud Logging rather than in chat, `stall-watch`, which sweeps the namespaces of every running or reconciling cluster that has a Cluster Agent every half hour for controllers that stopped reconciling and files a Cluster Agent card per namespace with a new stall, at most three a tick, posting one line when the card opens and one when it closes, and `feedback-prompt`, described below. `profile-cron-tick` is what makes it live: each watchdog is a real cron run in its own process, with that profile's persona, toolsets, `skills`, `model` and `max_turns`. No id may appear on both rosters — two rosters both carrying one is that audit running twice per schedule, concurrently with itself.

`eod-event-watcher-daily-report` is one of those: a script that renders the k8s-event-watcher recap straight from the session ledger and delivers its stdout verbatim. It sits here despite needing none of the profile's toolsets because what it reads belongs to the Platform Agent: the session database. Scripts are shared rather than per-profile (the entrypoint links `profiles/platform/scripts` at the shared directory), so `script` resolves here exactly as it does on the Planning Agent's roster.

`feedback-prompt` is the one entry that asks the operator something instead of reporting on the fleet. A week after its first tick it posts one message in the install's home chat channel: how kube-agents has been working out, the public feedback form's short link, the form's disclosure that a submission becomes a public issue, and that a reply in the thread reaches the agent. It is delivered once per install, guarded by two marker files in the Platform Agent's profile home on the data volume, `.feedback_prompt_armed` (the first tick, which starts the clock) and `.feedback_prompt_sent` (the claim, taken before the message is printed), so a pod restart or an upgrade never re-sends it; only an uninstall and reinstall does. It is at most once: a post the scheduler records as undelivered (the relay or the chat platform was down that day, or no chat platform was bound yet) is not retried, because the delivery record cannot tell a post that landed from one that did not, and a repeat would risk posting twice; removing `.feedback_prompt_sent` sends it again on the next tick. Two environment variables, set through the `PlatformAgent` CR's `spec.deployment.env`, are its per-install configuration: `FEEDBACK_PROMPT_ENABLED` (default `true`; `false` turns it off, and an install that turns it back on later still gets exactly one) and `FEEDBACK_PROMPT_DELAY` (default `7d`; `<n>d`, `<n>h` or `<n>m`; the job runs daily, so the message lands on the first 13:00 UTC tick at or after the delay, and a value that does not parse fails the run, which is reported in chat like any other script failure). The form URL is not configurable. `enabled: false` on the roster entry is the fleet-wide switch, as for every other job.

## The shipping jobs

Generated from [`agents/chat/defaults/cron/jobs.json`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/agents/chat/defaults/cron/jobs.json) and [`agents/platform/cron/jobs.json`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/agents/platform/cron/jobs.json). Retired ids are omitted: an id on its way out ships switched off for a release before it is deleted, and a disabled entry on the Platform Agent's roster is left out of this table rather than listed as a job an operator could reach. See [The retired jobs](/kube-agents/concepts/autonomous-watchdogs/#the-retired-jobs).

| `id`               | string          | Stable identifier used in observability and enable/disable ops. It survives renames — `obtainability-audit` is now the Workload Reliability Audit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `name`             | string          | Human-readable name for logs. For the audits it is also the ledger issue title, via the `AUDITS` map in `fleet-audit`'s `audit_report.py`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `risk`             | string          | Declared risk tier (`"low"` or `"high"`). For agentic jobs, `"high"` enforces a read-only policy (`cron_command_policy_block`); `"low"` retains the configured mode. Runtime-created jobs default to `"low"`, legacy volume entries backfill to `"low"`, and unannotated in-flight dispatches default fail-closed to `"high"`. For `no_agent: true` jobs, `"high"` is an input-threat label: repository events for `github-repo-watcher`, cluster status and event text for `stall-watch`, which its cards leave out and the Cluster Agent reads again.                  |
| `schedule.kind`    | string          | `"cron"` on every entry. `"interval"` is supported but unused: Hermes re-anchors an interval job to when the last run _finished_, and the gateway ticker sleeps a fixed 60 seconds after each tick returns, so a 1-minute interval fires every two.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `schedule.expr`    | string          | Standard 5-field cron expression, evaluated in the pod's time zone (UTC unless overridden).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `schedule.display` | string          | Display form (usually equal to `expr`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `prompt`           | string          | What the run is asked to do, copied verbatim into the turn. Governance jobs name their SOP **relative to the profile home** — `governance/<sop>.md`.

| `skills`           | array of string | The skills the run needs. The scheduler force-loads each one's text ahead of the first turn, rather than leaving the load to the model's discretion. The audit watchdogs use `fleet-audit`. A `no_agent` job prompts no model, so the field is ignored there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

See [Disabling a watchdog](/kube-agents/concepts/autonomous-watchdogs/#disabling-a-watchdog) — a deleted entry is not removed from a cluster that already has it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Every enabled job on the Platform Agent's roster uses `"chat"` or `"all"`, so a job that has stopped working is visible rather than indistinguishable from a quiet fleet, with one exception: `chat-delivery-watch` uses `"local"` because its product is a GitHub issue and a log line, and its purpose is to work when chat does not. |

## Editing

Adding or editing a job is a one-file change — see [Adding a watchdog](/kube-agents/concepts/autonomous-watchdogs/#adding-a-watchdog).

Edit `jobs.json`, then redeploy the agent image at the revision carrying the change:

```bash
./upgrade.sh --upgrade-mode=harness --image-tag=<SEMVER_TAG_OR_FULL_COMMIT_SHA>
```

The change is picked up on the next pod restart.

### How an edit reaches an existing pod

This part is about the **Planning Agent's** file, [`agents/chat/defaults/cron/jobs.json`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/agents/chat/defaults/cron/jobs.json) — the one the start-up reconcile below acts on. The Platform Agent's roster, which the rest of this page documents, reaches its profile by a separate path: `profile_scaffold.py` scaffolds it, and `merge_cron_store` merges it under the same per-key rule.

`$HERMES_HOME/cron/jobs.json` lives on the agent's persistent volume, and the scheduler writes `last_run` back into it on every tick — so the volume's copy is always newer than the image's, and the entrypoint's update-only defaults copy never overwrites it. Simply overwriting the file is not an option either: it would reset every `last_run` (making all jobs look due at once), discard the chat binding [first-run onboarding](/kube-agents/concepts/chatops/#first-run-onboarding) writes, and reinstate the two onboarding jobs that finishing onboarding deliberately removes.

So [`docker-entrypoint.sh`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/deploy/shared/docker-entrypoint.sh) runs [`cron_jobs_sync.py`](https://github.com/gke-labs/kube-agents/blob/main/agents/chat/scripts/cron_jobs_sync.py) before the scheduler starts, merging the image's declarations into the volume's file **by job id**. The merge is per key, not per field-list: **the image wins every key it ships, and every key it does not ship is left as the volume had it.**

- A job's **definition** — `name`, `schedule`, `prompt`, `skills`, `script`, `no_agent`, and `enabled` — is shipped, so it tracks the image. Shipping `enabled: false` is therefore the fleet-wide off switch described in [Disabling a watchdog](/kube-agents/concepts/autonomous-watchdogs/#disabling-a-watchdog); the cost is that a job whose `enabled` was set to false by hand on a live pod is switched back on by the next image roll. A job paused with `hermes cron pause` stays paused, because the pause also writes `state` and `paused_at`, which the image does not ship, and Hermes does not fire a job that carries them.
- The scheduler's own state — `last_run` and whatever else Hermes records per job — is shipped by nothing, so it survives untouched. Stating the rule this way rather than as a list of runtime-owned names is deliberate: a list has to be complete to be correct, and it stops being complete the day upstream records a new field.
- `deliver` is the single exception, because a runtime hook owns it: onboarding rewrites it to `origin` on the delivery job, and taking the image's value back would send the report nowhere.
- A job the image does not declare is never deleted; it may have been added by hand. Retirement therefore does not propagate to existing volumes — drop an id only once every live cluster has merged its disabled form.
- A job this script has installed before and that is now absent was removed on purpose, so it is not reinstalled. A ledger at `$HERMES_HOME/.cron_jobs_installed` records which ids those are.

The same start-up reconcile applies to the specialist profiles' `skills/` directories, which are wholly image-owned and replaced from the baked template on every start — see [Skills](/kube-agents/concepts/skills/#importing-external-skills).
