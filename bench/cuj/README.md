# Critical User Journey tests

This directory contains live, black-box functional tests for complete user
journeys through the admin portal API. Each test talks to Kage as a user and
scores only evidence returned by the deployed system.

From the repository root, run every CUJ with pytest:

```bash
uv run --project bench pytest -s bench/cuj
```

The suite targets the stock `platform-agent` resource created by
`install.sh`, through the connection the admin portal's Connection page saved
(`~/.kube-agent/state/admin-portal-connection.json`, or the path in
`KUBE_AGENTS_ADMIN_CONNECTION_STATE`). Set `CUJ_PROJECT_ID` for scenarios that
need a Google Cloud project. `CUJ_PROFILE`, `CUJ_TIMEOUT`, and
`CUJ_POLL_INTERVAL` are optional overrides shared by the whole suite.
Pytest reports every journey independently using its normal test discovery.
Before running a journey, `test_00_agent_responsive.py` requires the configured
agent to be discoverable and complete a minimal `READY` interaction through the
same admin portal path.
Each test starts an API-only portal on an OS-assigned loopback port and uses a
unique interaction session, so parallel workers do not share ports or sessions.
Each journey appends its request, each change in the portal interaction
projection (not every poll), acceptance criteria, milestones, and summary to
`interactions.jsonl` in a unique `/tmp/kube-agents-<scenario>-*` directory,
beside a readable `conversation.txt` shaped like the portal's Chat tab. Backend-independent acceptance
criteria determine the pytest result. Backend-specific milestones report
diagnostic progress but do not pass or fail the test. Both report the required
proof and observed evidence.

## Adding a journey

Add a normal pytest module at:

```text
bench/cuj/<area>/test_<NN>_<name>.py
```

Pytest discovers each journey without a registry or custom collector. A test
must:

- run from the repository root without relying on the caller's working
  directory;
- accept live configuration through environment variables;
- act through public interfaces rather than importing production internals;
- write interaction, acceptance, and milestone evidence beneath `/tmp`;
- use ordinary pytest assertions for configuration, transport, and acceptance
  failures.

Reuse acceptance reporting from `cuj.utils.acceptance_criteria`, configuration
from `cuj.utils.scenario`, evidence output from `cuj.utils.evidence`, portal
execution and projection helpers from `cuj.utils.interaction`, portal startup
from `cuj.utils.portal`, and dependency-aware diagnostic reporting from
`cuj.utils.milestones`. Keep only the prompt and scenario-specific acceptance
and milestone checks in the scenario, then expose it as an ordinary pytest
test:

```python
def test_02_example() -> None:
    Scenario(
        "cuj2",
        build_prompt,
        evaluate_acceptance,
        evaluate_backend_milestones,
    ).run_test()
```
