# The scenario driver for bench/tasks/bootstrap-discovery-fanout: re-arm the
# onboarding discovery gate on the install under test, wait for the
# `bootstrap-inventory-scan` cron job to file a fresh sweep card, and return
# once the sweep's worker has filed Cluster Agent cards and then ended its run
# itself, or has completed without filing any -- by then it has filed
# whatever Cluster Agent cards it is going to file, which is what the case
# grades. Short of that, it hands whatever the worker filed to the verifier
# at `run_wait`, or fails the apply if no worker has picked the sweep up by
# then or no read of the board has succeeded. It does not wait for the
# Cluster Agent cards itself: the worker's SOP polls them to the end inside
# its run, but a worker can end its run while they are still running
# (#1981). The destroy archives them, and archiving a running card ends its
# worker.
#
# Re-arming is the runbook in agents/chat/defaults/plugins/bootstrap_onboarding/
# README.md §5: the previous run's `bootstrap-inventory-*` cards are archived,
# newest first, and then the markers are removed.
#
# It refuses an install where a person has connected (`.user_aligned`) or
# onboarding already delivered (`.bootstrap_completed`): a fresh sweep there
# ends in a report sent to a real chat. It also refuses one whose
# `bootstrap-inventory-scan` job is missing or paused, where nothing would
# file the sweep.
