# The scenario driver for bench/tasks/bootstrap-inventory-ranking-delivery:
# plant a fixed INVENTORY.raw.md (inventory-raw.txt beside this file) on the
# shell sandbox's data volume, file the `bootstrap-inventory-prioritize` card
# the discovery sweep's worker files once it has written that file, wait until
# the card's worker has ended its run itself, or `run_wait` has passed, and
# then arm the delivery job by touching `.user_aligned`, the marker the
# onboarding plugin touches when a person first chats. The delivery job then
# picks up whatever report the worker wrote on its next tick. The apply fails
# if no worker has picked the card up by then or no read of the board has
# succeeded.
#
# The raw report goes on the sandbox because that is where the sweep's worker
# writes it: a kanban worker's terminal and file tools both run there. Its
# owner is set to the data volume's, the user those tools run as.
#
# It refuses an install where a person has connected (`.user_aligned`) or
# been greeted (`.bootstrap_greeted`), onboarding already delivered
# (`.bootstrap_completed`), either onboarding cron job is gone, the delivery
# job is paused, or it sends anywhere but `local`:
# the ranked report this produces is the one onboarding delivers, and arming
# delivery with a chat bound would post it there. It also refuses one whose
# gate has not filed its sweep (no `.bootstrap_scan_filed`), because a sweep
# filed during the run writes its own INVENTORY.raw.md over the planted one.
# Open `bootstrap-inventory-*` cards are archived before the plant, so an
# earlier sweep still running cannot do that either; the sweep marker stays,
# so the gate files no other.
#
# These checks are one read at the start, so the case is for an eval install
# nobody chats with: a person's first chat on the install during the run is
# sent the planted report, and a teardown after the arm removes their
# `.user_aligned`.
#
# Arming writes the two onboarding job records to `state_file` first. The
# teardown, and the exit trap on a failed apply, remove `.user_aligned` and
# `.bootstrap_completed` and put back either job the delivery removed, from
# those records; `state_file` existing is what says this stack armed it. An
# apply that finds `state_file` left by an earlier run finishes that teardown
# before its own checks.
