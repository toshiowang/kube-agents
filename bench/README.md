# bench

Evaluation harness that runs [kubernetes-sigs/devops-bench](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/devops-bench) against the Platform Agent, with devops-bench consumed as a pip-installed library (pinned git SHA — no PyPI release yet) instead of the legacy evaluator baked into the eval image. Tasks and the agent transport live here, so kube-agents and devops-bench ship independently.

## Layout

- `kube_agents_bench/harness.py` — the `kubeagents` agent harness: establishes `kubectl port-forward` to `svc/platform-agent` when the local port is closed, POSTs the task prompt to `/v1/responses`, and waits out any work the agent delegates to a subagent. That transport needs either a standard-runtime install or a relay pre-opened on its local port — see [Sandboxed installs](#sandboxed-installs). Environment variables are documented in the module docstring.
- `kube_agents_bench/inject_transport.py` — the door half of that second transport: the three HTTP calls (submit; the read that polls the transcript and the gateway's own record; the cancel), the fold of a conversation's transcript, the classification of how a task ended, and one submit-and-await exchange.
- `kube_agents_bench/board.py` — reads the awaited cards' statuses straight off the agent's kanban store (one `kubectl exec`, no model turn) on every poll of the delegation wait, so the harness spends a status turn through the model only when a card has settled and its result can be collected. A read that fails or does not know a card falls back to the status turn.
- `kube_agents_bench/gitops.py` — the GitOps fix-cycle wait the harness runs after delegated work when `GITOPS_RUN_BRANCH` is set: a pull request on the run branch, its merge or rejection, then Argo CD `Synced` at the branch head and `Healthy`; the outcome lands in the run record as a `gitops_fix_cycle` trajectory entry. See [docs/designs/gitops-fix-cycle.md](../docs/designs/gitops-fix-cycle.md).
- `kube_agents_bench/parsing.py` — pure payload and trajectory reading: maps a response onto devops-bench's canonical `AgentResult`, and reads back which kanban cards a turn filed, what statuses it reported, and what a finished card delivered.
- `kube_agents_bench/worker_trajectory.py` — reads the delegated workers' tool calls out of their hermes session stores once the cards settle, and appends them to the run record's `trajectory` tagged with the profile that made each call (`platform`, or a Cluster Agent's profile name). Without it a record carries only the front agent's `kanban_create` and cannot say what the worker read or where its fix came from. `tool_called` skips the tagged entries by default (`scope: router`) and counts them under `scope: workers`. The same read collects each worker session's token counts, so `tokens` in a delegated run's record is the front agent plus its workers, with the front agent's own numbers under `tokens.front_door` and the workers' under `tokens.workers` (per profile and summed; any session whose store had no counts is listed under `tokens.workers.unbilled`, so a partial sum says so). When the run delegated but no worker session could be billed, `tokens.workers` is `null` and the top level is the front agent's alone; a run that delegated nothing has neither key.
- `kube_agents_bench/cuj.py` — black-box CUJ evaluator for the portal's shared
  `/api/v1` interaction contract. It waits for aggregate terminal state before
  producing assertions.
- `kube_agents_bench/verifiers.py` — the leaf verifiers this repository adds to devops-bench's own, published through the `devops_bench.verifiers` entry-point group.
- `kube_agents_bench/discovery.py` — reads the onboarding discovery sweep off the agent pod for the `bootstrap_fanout` verifier: the sweep's board rows and the Cluster Agent profiles beside them, in one `kubectl exec`.
- `kube_agents_bench/onboarding.py` — reads the onboarding prioritization stage's `INVENTORY.items.json` off the shell sandbox pod for the `bootstrap_findings` verifier; the agent-pod exec the other readers use cannot reach the sandbox's volume.
- `kube_agents_bench/fleet.py` — resolves a seeded-fleet fixture ROLE to the kubeconfig that reaches it. Fails loudly rather than falling back to the ambient config; see [tf/fleet/README.md](tf/fleet/README.md).
- `kube_agents_bench/cases.py`, `scoring.py`, `baselines.py`, `gate.py` — the presubmit's verdict, described under [The gate](#the-gate) below. Nothing devops-bench calls; these read the records it writes.
- `tasks/` — task definitions. `agent-kanban-smoke` is a no-infrastructure smoke task that exercises the whole pipeline using only toolsets the deployed agent actually ships with. The rest are the Phase 2 domain scenarios; [`tasks/DRAFTS.md`](tasks/DRAFTS.md) is their status page.
- `baselines/` — screening evidence and `VERSIONS.json`, one append-only JSONL file per case, one batch of runs per line, each keyed on the five software versions a score depends on. Written by runs on `main`, read by every pull request. See [baselines/README.md](baselines/README.md).
- `scenarios/` — evaluation matrices using `Agent + Persona + Scenario + Goals
-> Run -> Assertions` terminology.
- `tests/` — offline tests: the harness against a local HTTP stub, and the gate against real run records captured from a live cluster (`tests/fixtures/runs/`).
- `hack/` — `run-gitops-pilot.sh`, the laptop driver for the `b-0011-gitops` and `b-0022b-gitops` cases (`TASK` picks one; optional devops-bench pin with the case rendered to `mode: hold`, result-row model, agent base branch, tokens, stack and harness env, cleanup; `GITOPS_REPO` and `AGENT_STATE_RESET` for an isolated run); `gitops-run-repo.sh`, one GitOps repository per run (create, mint check, archive); `gitops-audit.py`, the isolation counts of a run record; `gitops-compare.py`, two run records side by side.
- `tools/` — operator-run scripts that are neither tasks nor tests. `live_check_fleet_safeguards.py` drives every `fleet_resource_property` check in the cluster-debugging cases against a live cluster, through the real verifier, without running an agent.

To add a task or plug in a different agent, see
[CUSTOM-TASKS.md](CUSTOM-TASKS.md). To contribute a case to this repository — the format
it is held to, the fixture-sanitization rule, who owns it when it flakes, and how it earns a
seat on the merge-blocking roster — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

**Domain coverage.** `docs/designs/domains.yaml` lists eleven domains and an `allowlist` of the ones known to be uncovered; `scripts/test_domain_coverage.py` fails the build both for an uncovered domain missing from that list and for a listed domain that is in fact covered, so the list cannot rot in either direction. A domain counts as covered only when a task carries its `domain:` slug **and** a non-empty `verification_spec` **and** is a name on `hack/eval/blocking-roster.txt` — covered means able to red every pull request.

Nine of the eleven are covered and the allowlist holds two, `fleet-audits` and `remediation` (empty is Phase 2's exit criterion): `chat-and-routing` by the two kanban probes, `cluster-debugging` by `cluster-agent-crashloop-debug` (#939), `reliability`, `capacity`, `security`, `upgrades`, `consistency` and `cost` by the six domain probes — the probe-plus-canary recast the 2026-08-26 smoke run forced, after it priced a full audit at 600–1300s ([`tasks/DRAFTS.md`](tasks/DRAFTS.md) has the run and the reasoning) — and `incident-triage` by `incident-triage-oom-event-probe` (#1023, a roster seat since 2026-09-22). `fleet-audits` was covered by the `compliance-rbac-overgrant` canary from 2026-08-25 until 2026-09-22, when the presubmit became the blocking roster only (#1023) and the never-admitted canary moved to the nightly with `rca-remediation-pr` and five other held-out cases; since 2026-09-29 it is seated held out in the presubmit file (#2013 step 2) and still covers nothing; it comes off the allowlist at the canary's roster line (#2013 step 4). `remediation` lost its presubmit case the same day: `rca-remediation-pr` had been demoted since 2026-09-02 (#1189), and the promotion of `pdb-remediation-pr` proposed that day was withdrawn because its 12/12 nightly record was graded by the check #1780 replaced; `pdb-remediation-pr` is seated held out in the presubmit file too (#2016 step 2, seat opened 2026-09-28) and still covers nothing; it comes off at a remediation roster line earned under `pull_request_opened` (#2016 step 4). incident-triage's first case, `autoops-warning-event-triage`, which #1045 activated by giving it a scenario driver (`tf/prebuilt/autoops-incident`) that plants its own incident, has run in the nightly tier since 2026-09-03 (#1218), and the domain sat on the allowlist from then until the probe took its seat.

## Sandboxed installs

The harness reaches the agent with `kubectl port-forward`, which cannot reach a pod running under GKE Sandbox (gVisor) — the forward is set up in the host-side network namespace, and the listener lives in the sandbox's own. [`platformagent-crd.md`](../docs/site/src/content/docs/operator/platformagent-crd.md#specharness) is canonical on the constraint. `ENABLE_GVISOR` defaults to `true`, so a stock install is sandboxed.

The forward comes up anyway. `kubectl port-forward` binds its local port before anything dials the pod, so the port opens and the harness takes the tunnel for established; each request then dies inside the sandbox, and the harness treats that as it treats any dropped connection — three attempts with a tunnel reset between them, then a run recorded as infrastructure:

```
opening turn failed in transport (1/3): RemoteDisconnected: Remote end closed connection without response
```

What that leaves in `results.json` is an empty answer with `KUBE_AGENTS_INFRA_FAILURE` at the head of `errors`, which the judge grades as the agent's non-answer. ([The gate](#the-gate) reads the marker and calls the repetition infrastructure, but that is the presubmit, not a local run.) Nothing in it names the sandbox, and an agent pod that went away mid-run reports the same thing.

To run against a sandboxed install, pre-open the harness's local port with the `kubectl exec` relay:

```bash
python3 ../scripts/hermes-dashboard-tunnel.py \
  --container agent-api-auth --remote-port 8643 --local-port "${AGENT_LOCAL_PORT:-8642}"
```

Leave it running alongside the eval. `_ensure_port_forward` treats an already-open port as a no-op — it never assumes it owns the transport — so the harness rides the relay instead of spawning a forward that cannot work. The script is named for the dashboard, but the relay under it ([`scripts/exec_tunnel.py`](../scripts/exec_tunnel.py)) is general, and these flags point it at the credential-proxy sidecar that fronts the agent API.

The relay resolves the pod against whichever kubectl context is current, where the harness pins `AGENT_CLUSTER_CONTEXT` on every call, so point the current context at the agent's cluster before starting it. A task that provisions a cluster then repoints that context under you — `gcloud container clusters get-credentials`, the hazard `AGENT_CLUSTER_CONTEXT` exists for — and since the relay opens a `kubectl exec` per connection, every request from there on lands on the task cluster and fails the way the sandbox does. Give those tasks an unsandboxed agent.

Above one replica, pass `--pod` too. A pod that does not hold the leader lease never starts the gateway, and the operator reports it Ready on purpose — its probe counts a refused connection as healthy while leader election is on — so the relay, which takes the first Ready pod matching the label, can settle on one with nothing listening.

To run the agent unsandboxed: `ENABLE_GVISOR=false` at install time, or in `install.env` before a full `upgrade.sh`, which re-renders the runtime class from it — read [`scripts/installer/README.md`](../scripts/installer/README.md) on what else that apply rewrites before you run it on an install you care about. CI reaches the same place by overriding the chart value directly, which a throwaway cluster can afford: `hack/ci-deploy.sh` pins `runtimeClassName` empty before `hack/ci-eval-pr.sh` runs, and says why.

## Running evals

```bash
cd bench
uv sync
export PROJECT_ID=<gcp project> CLUSTER_NAME=<cluster> AGENT_CLUSTER_CONTEXT=<kubectl context>
export BENCH_TF_ROOT=./tf
PLATFORM_AGENT_TOKEN=$(kubectl get secret platform-agent-secrets -n <namespace> \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.API_SERVER_KEY}' | base64 --decode) \
  JUDGE_PROVIDER=<provider> JUDGE_MODEL=<model> \
  uv run devops-bench ./tasks/<id> --agent-type kubeagents
```

This is the stock `devops-bench` CLI — there is no wrapper command. `source` is positional, and `./tasks` runs every case. The exports are what `hack/ci-eval-pr.sh` sets, so a local run grades the way the presubmit does; a case with `fixtures:` also needs `BENCH_FLEET_KUBECONFIG_DIR` from `hack/fleet-kubeconfigs.sh`, which by hand needs `FLEET_ALLOW_RUNNER_CREDENTIAL=1` or a reader you can impersonate (the linked rule says which). `--no-infra` smokes the agent path only: it skips the deterministic checks, so such a run can neither pass nor fail the gate. [`.agents/rules/eval_driven_development.md`](../.agents/rules/eval_driven_development.md) is the loop that uses this. See `--help` for the rest.

Without a GCP project, `hack/kind-up.sh` (see [`INSTALL.md`](../INSTALL.md), Method 3) installs the agent in a local kind cluster and prints the exports for this command. `tasks/chat-routing-own-cluster-namespaces` is a simple eval that should work on kind.

## Transports

The harness reaches the agent through one of two doors, selected by `AGENT_TRANSPORT`. Everything else about a run is the same: the same `KubeAgentsHarness`, the same `AgentResult`, the same transcript stash the verifiers read.

- `api` (the default): `kubectl port-forward` to `svc/platform-agent` and `POST /v1/responses`, followed by status turns on the same conversation while delegated cards settle. This door is identical under `spec.mode: today` and `spec.mode: next`, so a run through it says nothing about the next stack.
- `inject`: the prompt is `POST`ed to the A2A gateway's inject door, which enters `handleInbound` like a message from any chat backend — routing, the session record, `startTask`, the bus, and the relay posting the reply back. The harness port-forwards the inject Service (`<cr>-a2a-inject`, port 8099) and awaits the terminal of the task the POST returned — a task id in that reply means the submission reached the bus, because the door answers only once the gateway's publish has returned. What it grades is what the conversation received, which is what a customer would have read.

The door is rendered only when the operator itself was deployed with `A2A_INJECT_BACKEND=true`, it listens on the gateway pod's loopback (so the port-forward is the only way in, and the Service exists to give it a name), and every request to it carries a bearer token — see the test-backend section of [`spec-chatops-gateway.md`](../docs/designs/spec-chatops-gateway.md). Export it the way the presubmit exports the agent's own key:

```bash
export AGENT_INJECT_TOKEN=$(kubectl get secret platform-agent-a2a-inject \
  -n kubeagents-system -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode)
```

Every case and repetition gets a fresh conversation, `inject:<run>/<case>/<rep>` (the run id is a `devops-bench-<hex>` id minted fresh per invocation, never `AGENT_CONVERSATION_ID`, which is the api path's: a pinned id would have the door's dedupe answer a rerun with a previous invocation's task; the case and repetition are `EVAL_CASE_ID` and `EVAL_REPETITION`), and the same triple is the backend message id, which the gateway's ingress log joins to the `correlationId` and the door dedupes a retried POST on; each status turn of the delegation wait carries its own, `<run>/<case>/<rep>/status-<n>`. The record stores the three beside the task id. Every poll carries `probe=1`, so the gateway's read route — a pure read of the session record and the task's stream, which heals and routes nothing — is where the task's lifecycle comes from: each executor state it shows (`submitted`, `working`) and the terminal land in the trajectory as `a2a.status-update` entries, and the scorer's rung 3 accepts the final one (or a `working` one, for a graded timeout) in place of a token count, which the gateway does not report. When the stream is terminal the read also carries the fold of it: whose word the terminal is, the result artifact's text and the terminal's message.

The prompt is routed the way any text is, the gateway's literal affordances included (a message whose first word is `delegate`, or whose whole text is `stop`, reaches those paths instead of the persona). The harness sends none of them, and a case whose prompt opens with one is the case's defect, not the transport's.

The harness classifies from what it reads, never from a message sent to find out (every message is a turn) and never from a clock beside the gateway's grace. Infrastructure, never graded: an install with no door, a missing or refused token, a submission the door refused — the reply's refusal code says which, an author its principal map does not carry (`unverified-author`), a task the gateway minted and could not publish (`publish-failed`), a turn answered as a steer or a stop (`no-task`), or a bound that expired with the gateway saying nothing, or an answer the door's own retention scrolled past (`no-answer`) — a task whose stream shows no event past the gateway's first-event grace (no executor took it), a task that only ever reached `submitted` by `AGENT_INJECT_TIMEOUT` (queued behind the bridge's concurrency cap for the whole budget; cancelled, and the bridge answers `canceled-before-start`), a task that went past `submitted` but never reached `working` by the budget (an executor parked it at `input-required` or `auth-required`; the harness's rule here is the scorer's rung-3 liveness rule, `shows_a_run`, so a fold it grades is never a record the rung then refuses; cancelled), a terminal the gateway declared about a task it could not put on the bus, a terminal the supervisor declared about an executor that died or never ran, a failed terminal carrying one of the executors' own reasons (`bridge-shutdown`, `bridge-queue-overflow`, `bus-publish-failed`, `spawn-failed`, `bridge-died-without-terminal-event`, `worker-evicted`, `bus-subscribe-failed`, read from the `reason: <token>` the terminal carries), a `rejected` terminal, and a deadline the read cannot classify. Graded, with the terminal and its reason on `errors`: a task an executor took and ended `failed` or `canceled` for any other reason, including one the harness does not know, a task still `working` at the budget, graded on what it produced (its `canceled` after the harness's own cancel is the timeout, not infrastructure), and a task whose record the relay left active on a finished stream — the relay acks a terminal before it clears the record, and on a key never reused no heal arrives — graded from the fold the read carries, with the result text as the answer, when the terminal is the executor's (the supervisor's, about an executor that died, is infrastructure). Every outcome that leaves an active task — working, queued or parked at the budget, never taken, unclassifiable — is followed by a cancel naming the task id the POST answered with, after the read and never before it, and the classification never comes from the cancel's answer: it bounds a stray run, because the submission of a task nobody took is still on the bus for a bridge that binds later, and the gateway's own heal releases the record on the cancel turn, which is why the cancel names the task. The bridge honours that cancel before it spawns ([`a2a/docs/hermes-bridge.md`](../a2a/docs/hermes-bridge.md), "Lifecycle, steering, cancel", is canonical for how): it answers `canceled-before-start` without a spawn, the terminal a task still queued gets, and a cancel that lands after its read kills the run inside the kill grace with `canceled-by-request`. `AGENT_INJECT_TIMEOUT` defaults to 1800 s; its floor is the grace plus a margin, read from the gateway before the POST, and a budget below the floor is refused with nothing started. An eval install that declares the bridge sidecar sets `BRIDGE_CONCURRENCY` to at least `EVAL_TASK_PARALLELISM`, or the units past the cap sit queued and are classified as infrastructure rather than run.

What each transport gives the verifiers:

The marker says the door could show calls; on a record without it, or whose marker reports a loss (`dropped`, `malformed`, `input_truncated` or `stale` non-zero: the trajectory may not carry every call), `bench-gate` reports the check as not applicable on this transport rather than failed, and a case with no other objective as not graded on the lane; a `none`-wrapped check that failed on a record carrying the marker stays graded whatever the loss, since the trace shows the forbidden call ([the gate](#the-gate)) |

Delegation on the inject path is a seam, not a feature: the kanban poll behind the wait stays in the case runner and issues follow-up messages on the same conversation, but card ids come from `kanban_create` tool results, which the door's trace does not carry, so it settles at once. It is deliberately not in the transport, so it can be deleted whole when agent-initiated delegation becomes a child task on the bus. The rebuilt wait this path needs — card ids and statuses read from the result text, the status question sent as a new turn, worker logs read by those ids — is a follow-up, and until it lands `worker_commands` has no data here, as the table above says.

## The gate

devops-bench scores a run; it does not decide whether a pull request may merge. That decision is `bench-gate`, and `hack/ci-eval-pr.sh` is what drives it (when its step-0 revalidation has not already reused the pull request's prior green verdict): the shell runs each task `EVAL_REPETITIONS` times (default 3) and hands the resulting run **directories** to the scorer, which reads `results.json` for the scores, `manifest.json` for `setupId`, and `rows.json` for `scoringVersion`.

```bash
uv run bench-gate case --task ./tasks/<id>/task.yaml \
  --result <run-dir> --result MISSING --result <run-dir> \
  --json-out case-<id>.json          # exit 0 with a verdict, 2 if it could not grade
uv run bench-gate suite --case-result case-<id>.json --markdown-out verdict.md
                                     # exit 0 green, 1 red, 2 not evaluated
uv run bench-gate record --case-result case-<id>.json   # main only; appends evidence
```

The gate is rate-based, not all-must-pass: at a few hundred cases and realistic per-case reliability, "every case green" is a state the suite reaches on a vanishing fraction of runs, and a gate that reds most pull requests gets switched off. So a case is graded on a ladder — a forbidden action, a declared check that never ran, or a record whose liveness signals are inconsistent reds the job outright (a record showing no run at all — empty trajectory, zero billed tokens — is excluded as infrastructure instead, #1184); a case that merely _fails_ reds it only by failing **every** repetition, and only once the baseline store holds screening evidence that the case is reliable enough to mean something. Green has a coverage floor of its own: an admitted case that lost every repetition to infrastructure was not evaluated, and the run then reports **not evaluated** rather than green — `suite` exits 2, the JSON carries `outcome: not_evaluated` with the case ids, and the verdict says rerun when the environment is healthy rather than debug the change. A blocking case still outranks that: the run is red. On the inject transport a check that reads the delegated workers (`worker_commands`, `worker_agents`, a `tool_called` in the `workers` or `all` scope) is set aside as not applicable rather than failed, and so is a `tool_called` in its default `router` scope on a record whose door showed no tool-call trace (no `a2a.activity` marker) or whose trace lost calls (a marker reporting a loss), except a `none`-wrapped one that failed, which is positive evidence and stays graded; a case left with no objective to grade is `NOT_GRADED_ON_TRANSPORT` — evaluated, outside the pass rate, neither a collapse nor weather ([`docs/designs/eval-scorer.md`](../docs/designs/eval-scorer.md), "The inject lane sets aside what its transport cannot show").

That evidence is what `baselines/` holds, and admission is computed from it rather than declared in `task.yaml` — a case cannot admit itself in the same diff that makes it pass. A case with no record at the current version key is reported unadmitted, and one whose record was measured on different software is reported _stale_ rather than silently compared against.

**The loop closes through `record`.** Everything a pull request is compared against comes from lines that a run on `main` appended, so the store fills itself: each nightly run appends its own repetitions, the reader pools the newest lines at a key until it holds 20 runs, and a case is admitted once that pooled evidence clears the bar — seven nights from empty at `EVAL_REPETITIONS=3`, the default the nightly inherits (the pool takes whole lines, so it lands on 21). What that window decides is `EVAL_ADMISSION_MODE`: under `roster`, the default, `BOOTSTRAP_ADMITTED` decides what blocks and the verdict's **Record says** column reports what the record would do (`would-admit`, `would-demote`, `collecting`, `stale`) beside the **Admitted by** column; under `record`, the record decides either way once it holds a full window, and a case that starts failing pushes its own passing history out and stops being able to red the job. `record` refuses to run with `PULL_NUMBER` set, and the shell only calls it on a run whose `JOB_TYPE` is `periodic` or `postsubmit`. Where those lines land is `EVAL_BASELINE_STORE`: unset, they append to `baselines/` in the checkout, which is hermetic and needs no credential but has no way to commit itself from CI; set to `gs://bucket/prefix`, each batch becomes one immutable object under a `roles/storage.objectCreator` grant that cannot overwrite or delete, which is what actually closes the loop on `main`. `VERSIONS.json` stays in git either way. See [docs/designs/eval-scorer.md](../docs/designs/eval-scorer.md).

Two speeds, deliberately: the deterministic `Verification*` scores decide whether a repetition passed, and no judged score can fail a repetition on its own. The captured fixtures are the argument — three byte-identical failing runs scored `OutcomeValidity` 0.9, 1.0 and 0.2 while `VerificationCorrectness` held at 0.5 on all three. The judge is given exactly one job (rung 6): catching a **collapse** in judged quality against main's mean at the same version key, at a margin of two standard errors of that measured spread. At three repetitions it cannot see drift, and widening it is a matter of more repetitions or a less variable metric, not a smaller number.

Thresholds are named environment variables, all with the documented default: `EVAL_REPETITIONS`, `DETERMINISTIC_CORRECTNESS_FLOOR`, `EVAL_ADMISSION_RATE`, `EVAL_ADMISSION_MIN_RUNS`, `EVAL_AGGREGATE_MARGIN`, `EVAL_AGGREGATE_MIN_SCORED`, `EVAL_AGGREGATE_ARMED` (unset by default: the suite aggregate is computed and reported against main's rate but cannot red the job until this is set to `1`, `true` or `yes`), `EVAL_JUDGED_MARGIN`, `EVAL_JUDGED_METRICS`, `EVAL_BASELINE_STORE`, `EVAL_BASELINE_MAX_OBJECTS`, `EVAL_BASELINE_CAT_WORKERS` (default 16: how many per-case `gcloud storage cat` calls a GCS read runs at once), `EVAL_ADMISSION_MODE` (`roster` by default: the list decides and the record is reported; `record`: the record decides once it holds a full window) and `BOOTSTRAP_ADMITTED` (the blocking roster, read from `hack/eval/blocking-roster.txt`; [`docs/eval-gate-roster.md`](../docs/eval-gate-roster.md) has the decision and what the record must show before the mode changes).

## Portal CUJ evaluations

The portal evaluator is the black-box path for conversational CUJs with
asynchronous work. It creates an interaction, observes approvals according to
the Persona, waits until the root run and delegated tasks are terminal, and only
then evaluates Goals. It does not modify kube-agents to signal test completion.

The matrix terms are:

- **Agent** — portal API endpoint, black-box agent ID, and profile.
- **Persona** — the complete user role, actor identity/credential reference,
  description, and approval policy.
- **Scenario** — prompt, timeout, polling policy, and ordered Goals.
- **Tool Goal** — requires trusted `toolCalls` evidence. Response prose or a
  promise to act cannot pass it.
- **Message Goal** — required/forbidden response signals plus an optional
  semantic rubric.
- **Soft Goal** — quality rubric with deterministic limits and an injected
  semantic judge. Without a judge its assertion is inconclusive, never passed.
- **Run** — one observed conversation and terminal interaction projection.
- **Assertion** — pass, fail, or inconclusive evidence for completion or one
  Goal, including repair diagnostics.

When a Persona's credential reference resolves to a token, its Agent endpoint
must use HTTPS, except on a loopback host (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `localhost`),
where the token never leaves the machine. The evaluator rejects redirects
instead of forwarding the credential; configure the Agent with the final
canonical API URL.

Run the checked-in read-only smoke matrix against a locally running portal.
Every portal `/api/v1` request requires the portal's launch capability, so set
`KUBE_AGENTS_PORTAL_API_TOKEN` (at least 32 characters) before starting
`scripts/admin_portal.sh` — otherwise the portal generates a random token the
evaluator cannot know — and run the matrix with the same value:

```bash
cd bench
KUBE_AGENTS_PORTAL_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8501/api/v1 \
KUBE_AGENTS_PORTAL_API_TOKEN=<the portal's token> \
EXPECTED_PROJECT=<project> \
EXPECTED_CLUSTER=<cluster> \
EXPECTED_LOCATION=<location> \
uv run python -m kube_agents_bench.cuj scenarios/portal-readonly-smoke.json
```

The command prints the real user and assistant messages plus the complete
interaction and assertions as JSON. Exit status is zero only when the
interaction completed and every Goal passed. Portal coverage exercises the Chat
Agent front door and its delegation chain; Google Chat Pub/Sub and Slack ingress
remain separate transport Scenarios.

`hack/ci-eval-pr.sh` exports `PLATFORM_AGENT_TOKEN` for you in CI. The harness also honours the same `AGENT_*` variables as the legacy runner.

Tasks that provision infrastructure name their OpenTofu stack relative to `BENCH_TF_ROOT`; point it at a stack directory in this repo so the eval never depends on stacks bundled with the library:

```bash
AGENT_CLUSTER_CONTEXT=gke_<project>_<location>_<agent-cluster> \
  PROJECT_ID=<project> CLUSTER_NAME=<task-cluster> \
  BENCH_TF_ROOT=./tf uv run devops-bench ./tasks --agent-type kubeagents
```

`PROJECT_ID` and `CLUSTER_NAME` are required once infrastructure is on; without them the run exits before provisioning. Set `AGENT_CLUSTER_CONTEXT` for these too. Bringing up a task cluster — provisioned per run, or an existing one reused via a stack's `reuse_existing_cluster` — runs `gcloud container clusters get-credentials`, which repoints kubectl's current context at it; without the pin, the harness port-forwards into the task cluster, where the agent does not run.

A stack under `tf/` does not have to vendor the upstream OpenTofu modules — reference them over git, pinned to a SHA:

```hcl
module "cluster" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/devops-bench.git//tf/modules/cluster?ref=<sha>"
}
```

The deployer scans `*.tf` in the stack directory only and never descends into modules, so re-declare every variable you want to reach the module in the stack's own `variables.tf` and pass it through. A variable a task's `variables:` block sets but the stack does not declare raises `ConfigError`; one the runner injects is dropped with a log warning.

## Registration

The harness is registered solely by the `devops_bench.agents` entry point declared in `pyproject.toml`. devops-bench scans that group on the first unresolved agent lookup, so `--agent-type kubeagents` resolves without importing this package — nothing in the invocation references `kube_agents_bench` by name. Importing the harness module has no side effects.

## Tests

```bash
cd bench
uv sync
uv run pytest tests
```

No cluster or `kubectl` required — the suite drives the full request → parse → `AgentResult` path against a local stub, and grades the gate against run records captured from a live cluster and then mutated. Every gate failure mode is a mutation of a real record rather than a hand-written dict, so a test cannot agree with the scorer about a field devops-bench does not actually emit; `tests/fixtures/runs/README.md` records where the captures came from.
