"""Stands in for a script that cannot run in the shell sandbox.

The sandbox holds the agent's shell, and some of what a SKILL.md tells the model
to run is not a shell command in any useful sense: it needs the `hermes` binary,
the profiles tree on the agent pod's PVC, the session database, or Hermes' own
Python namespace. None
of those crossed the boundary and none of them should — the point of #737 is
that code the model runs cannot reach them.

Leaving the file out entirely was the other option. It reads worse: the model
gets `No such file or directory`, concludes the image is broken or the path is
wrong, and spends a turn or two proving it. This says what is actually true and
exits non-zero, so the failure carries its own explanation.

Copied to each such path by deploy/sandbox/Dockerfile, which is also where the
list of them lives.
