# Smoke test for the agent shell sandbox image: starts a container, connects to
# it the way the agent pod does, and checks the things this image exists to
# provide.
#
# Worth having as a file rather than a checklist because none of it is visible
# from the Dockerfile. Whether a variable reaches the agent's shell depends on
# sshd's parser, the session type, and which of three mechanisms sets it; the
# first version of this image got PATH right and CREDENTIAL_PROXY_URL wrong,
# and every static check in the repository passed on it.
#
# Usage: deploy/sandbox/smoke-test.sh [image] [port]
#
# shellcheck disable=SC2016
#   Remote commands are single-quoted throughout and that is the point: the
#   expansion has to happen in the sandbox, not in this shell. A double-quoted
#   `echo "$PATH"` would test the caller's PATH and pass.
#
# No `set -e`: a failing check is data this script reports, not a reason to
# abandon the run. `check` counts them and the exit status at the bottom is the
# verdict.
