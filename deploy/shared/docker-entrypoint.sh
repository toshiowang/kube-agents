# 1.5 Exactly one container per pod runs the setup BELOW this line. The others stop here.
#
# "Below this line" is the whole of the claim. Step 1 is deliberately above it and runs in
# every container, including the sidecars — stage2-hook.sh is upstream's own container-local
# init, and it touches the shared tree too (it chowns $TARGET_DIR and $TARGET_DIR/profiles,
# and lays down the Hermes skeleton: config.yaml, sessions/, skills/, logs/). That is
# unchanged from before this gate existed and is not what corrupts a profile; it is
# idempotent and every container genuinely needs it. Worth knowing all the same, because
# "the sidecar does not write to the PVC" is the obvious reading of this gate and it is
# false. If you are hunting a write nobody claims to make, look above, not below. It also
# means $TARGET_DIR/logs is NOT evidence that this setup ran — use scripts/ or
# profiles/platform/profile.yaml, which only the steps below create.
#
# The Deployment runs this image more than once against ONE data PVC — the gateway and
# the dashboard (`hermes dashboard`) — and they are not equivalent. The operator mounts
# the plugin OCI volumes and the operator-rendered overlay ConfigMap into the gateway
# container ONLY, so the same setup code sees a different world in each, and everything
# below writes to the shared tree.
#
# Left ungated, the dashboard's pass actively undoes the gateway's:
#
#   - Step 2.65 links profiles/<p>/plugins/<plugin> -> /opt/agent-plugins/... . That path
#     does not exist in the dashboard container, so its prune_stale_links() reads the
#     gateway's fresh link as dangling and silently removes it.
#   - Step 2.7 merges /opt/agent-config. That directory does not exist there either, so
#     the merge finds no overlay and reverts the one already applied — it logs
#     "unapplied previous overlay" — dropping the plugin from plugins.enabled.
#
# Both containers race to finish, and the loser's work is erased. The symptom lands far
# away and looks like something else entirely: a worker exits 1 with "Unknown skill(s)",
# the task retries twice, the dispatcher gives up, and the board fills with blocked tasks
# while the AgentPlugin still reports Ready and the image is still correctly mounted.
# Step 5's Session KV server has the same shape of problem — two containers, one pod
# network namespace, one port 8699.
#
# WHO OWNS IT is answered by AGENT_SHARED_STATE_SETUP first and by the command line only
# as a fallback. Under the operator the variable is always set — `owner` on the gateway,
# `skip` on the dashboard (buildBaseContainers in platformagent_manifests.go) — so the
# fallback never runs there. It exists for deployments with no operator to ask: compose,
# plain manifests, `docker run`.
#
# The variable comes first because argv is not reliable evidence. At more than one replica
# the gateway container runs `python3 $HERMES_HOME/leader_elect.py`, which starts
# `hermes gateway run` as a child; the word `gateway` appears nowhere in its own argv, so
# argv detection excludes the one container that must do the setup. It reads as a sidecar

    # What this REPLACED is a subPath mount. The operator used to project the rendered

    # a file, but a mount is not conditional: it shadowed the PVC copy on every volume,
    # so this container read a DIFFERENT config from the gateway's and narrowing the
    # render narrowed this container's whole world with it. It did not even shadow
    # RELIABLY — the bind lives in this container's mount namespace, and the owner
    # replacing config.yaml atomically from its own namespace destroys it outright (the
    # rename does not even get EBUSY, having no bind of its own at that path), so the
    # sidecar read the render until the owner's first write and the PVC file after it.

# step 2 copies /opt/defaults onto the PVC and sync_profile_skills installs
# $PLATFORM_TEMPLATE/skills and $CLUSTER_TEMPLATE/skills into each profile. Failing at
# this line leaves the PVC exactly as the last good boot left it.
#
# It is the DETECTION half of the pair; the barrier is that these trees, and the two
# templates around them, are root-owned in the image while the agent runs as uid 10000
# (the ownership comment in deploy/docker/Dockerfile has the reasoning, including why
# the modes are left writable-looking). Read it as "this image's skills are the ones it
# was built with", not as a runtime sandbox.
#
# The manifest, not the script, decides whether the check is mandatory. Both sides are
# root-owned in the image — the manifest inside the tree it describes, the verifier in
# /opt/defaults/scripts — so neither is something the runtime user removes, and the
# FATAL branch below reads as a corrupted or mis-built image rather than as the last
# thing standing between an agent and a disabled check. It is kept because the
# alternative to reporting a missing checker is skipping the tree it would have checked:
# a tree that carries a manifest is verified or the container does not start. A tree
# with no manifest beside it is one no manifesting build produced (agent-base ships
# /opt/hermes/skills and never reaches the platform stage) and is skipped, which is also
# what makes this a no-op on a developer host.
#
# Fail-closed, which is a deliberate departure from the WARN-and-continue that every
# other step here uses. Those steps degrade to a stale file; this one degrades to
# running instructions nobody can account for, which is the whole thing it exists to
# report. The blast radius is bounded on the other side: the manifest ships in the same
# image layer as the files it covers and the build asserts it is complete, so a mismatch
# is never a version skew between the two — it is the image having changed since it was
# built. There is deliberately no env-var override; a bypass switch would be readable to
# exactly the caller this is meant to be honest with.

# 1.7 Convert the SQLite databases on this volume out of WAL, once, when the operator
# has pinned `database.journal_mode: delete` in the managed scope.
#
# The operator pins it whenever the agent pod has a runtime class (renderConfigYAML in
# platformagent_manifests.go): under gVisor the volume is a 9p gofer mount that accepts
# WAL and then corrupts it, and two databases went that way in three days (#610).
# Hermes honours the pin for a database it creates, but never downgrades one whose
# header already reads WAL — apply_wal_with_fallback returns an on-disk WAL database
# before it consults the setting, because a live downgrade under a concurrent opener
# destroys committed-but-uncheckpointed frames. So a volume that ran in WAL before the
# pin, which is every install this was written for, needs one conversion, and it has
# to happen HERE: after the lock above, so one container does it, and before step 2,
# because everything below opens a database somewhere (the cron reconcile, the kanban
# board, the session store). The non-owner's wait below the shared-state gate is the
# other half: a sidecar holds off opening a database until this has run.
#
# The script checkpoints each database with TRUNCATE first and switches only when
# SQLite reports the switch took. A database another process holds open is left as it
# is and logged, and the next start retries; nothing here can make a file worse than
# WAL already left it. Best-effort: the gate is in the script (no pin, no conversion),
# so an image started without the operator — compose, a plain manifest, the kustomize
# bases — runs a no-op, and a host without the venv skips the step outright.

# at runtime bumps its mtime the same way. Both leave a stale persona live across
# the image roll that was supposed to replace it. (Rollback to an older image and

# When an upgraded container image starts over an existing PVC, the stale cached tool list
# shadows newly added or modified tools indefinitely (Issue #854).
# Dropping local server entries forces Hermes to re-discover tools on first connect.
# Remote servers (e.g. developer_knowledge, gke) are preserved to avoid unnecessary
# network round-trips.

# 2d. Seed the default profile's config.yaml, and check that the managed scope carrying
# the operator's pins actually arrived.
#
# The pins do NOT come through this file. They are mounted read-only at
# $HERMES_MANAGED_DIR (/etc/hermes) as Hermes' managed scope, and Hermes overlays them,
# per leaf key, on top of whatever config.yaml holds — on every load, in both the CLI
# (hermes_cli/config.py) and the gateway (gateway/config.py). So $TARGET_DIR/config.yaml
# stays the agent's own writable file and nothing HERE has to merge into it. Step 2.7
# does merge the operator's mutable settings into it, from profile-default.overlay.yaml,
# and it runs after this step for the reason given there.
#
# Two earlier shapes did need to, and both were worse:
#
#   * The operator subPath-mounted its rendering over $TARGET_DIR/config.yaml. A subPath
#     mount is a read-only mount POINT, so the agent could no longer save anything to its
#     own config: `/sethome` failed with EACCES (os.replace over a mount point gives
#     EBUSY, and the copyfile fallback then gives EACCES), the monitoring policy could
#     not persist `monitoring.install_id`, and every saved slash-command preference was
#     lost. The error the user saw had the path scrubbed out of it by the Slack egress
#     sanitiser, so it read "Permission denied: ''".
#   * Rebuilding the file here from image + overlay + the runtime's own edits fixed the
#     writability, but every rebuilt key stayed mutable. The merge rule — runtime wins
#     where the baseline has not moved — is what made that dangerous: a value the agent
#     wrote for itself survived every restart, so an agent that repointed model.base_url
#     at nothing could not be recovered by restarting it.
#
# The image's copy lives at /opt/chat-template, NOT in /opt/defaults, precisely so that
# step 2's `cp -ru` cannot reach it: that copy is mtime-driven and races an image roll,
# and losing the live file to it would discard the runtime's own state.

# and seeds $HERMES_HOME/config.yaml from Hermes' own cli-config.yaml.example
# (docker/stage2-hook.sh, `seed_one "config.yaml" "cli-config.yaml.example"`), so by the
# time control reaches here the file always exists — on a brand-new PVC as much as on a
# ten-week-old one. Testing `! -f` therefore tested for a state that never occurs, and
# the whole fresh-volume path below was dead code.
#
# What that cost is not subtle, and only a fresh volume shows it: the back-fill is
# FILL-ONLY, so every key the example already spells out keeps ITS value, forever. A new
# install came up on upstream defaults for terminal, browser, code_execution, delegation,
# telemetry, database and streaming — none of which the image template had any way to
# correct, because they were present, not missing. Measured on a live cluster: 26
# top-level keys and 6488 bytes of upstream example where the template asks for 9 keys,
# with the template's contribution reduced to the 12 keys the example happened to omit.
#
# So detect the example itself. stage2 copies it verbatim and only chowns/chmods after,
# so a byte-compare against the file it copied FROM is exact at this moment, and it is
# the one moment that matters. It cannot false-positive on a real install: Hermes
# rewrites the file on first save, the managed-scope strip empties `model:`, and this
# very step back-fills into it — any of which ends the equality. And if a future Hermes
# templates the example on the way in and the compare stops matching, this degrades to
# the back-fill below, which is exactly today's behaviour: no worse, just not better.
#
# A function, and not three lines inline, so the tests can lift it out and run it against
# real files the way they already lift the back-fill program out of its heredoc — the
# branch it feeds sits in the owner-only path, which no unit test can reach.

# 2c. Retire the cron ids this release moved off the default profile's roster,
# and land the tick job that replaces them.
#
# Step 2's `cp -ru` cannot touch this file and never could: the scheduler
# rewrites $TARGET_DIR/cron/jobs.json on every tick, so the volume's copy is
# always newer than the image's and the update-only copy always skips it. Step
# 2c-bis below is the general reconcile for that. This step is the half it cannot
# do, because cron_jobs_sync.py never prunes: its ledger stops a retired job
# coming BACK, it never removes one the volume already has.
#
# `--cron-retire` deletes the governance ids from this roster outright. They ran
# here only while the platform profile's store had no ticker; now that
# `profile-cron-tick` gives it one, they are back on the Platform Agent's own
# roster where the scheduler can reach their `skills`, `model` and `max_turns`
# (see profile_cron_tick.py). Dropping the shipped entries is not enough on its
# own: an upgraded PVC would go on firing its enabled copies here while step 2.6
# fires the re-enabled originals over there — every audit running twice, against
# itself. Retiring the ids is what makes the move a move rather than a fork.
#
# stockout-prevention moves for the same reason as the other seven, one release
# later: it landed on this roster after the move was written, so it is the one id
# here that an upgraded PVC can be carrying while no default-profile roster in
# this image ships it. Retiring it and shipping it on the Platform Agent's roster
# is the same move, applied late.
#
# It runs BEFORE 2c-bis deliberately, and the two lists must not overlap. The
# order only decides how fast an accidental overlap bites, not whether it does:
# retire-last would delete a job the image still ships on every single boot,
# while retire-first survives exactly one. cron_jobs_sync records every id in
# the image roster in its ledger on the boot it reinstalls one, and from the
# next boot on it reads "in the ledger, absent from the file" as a deliberate
# runtime removal and leaves it out for good. Neither order self-corrects, so
# an id belongs on this list only once no roster in this image ships it.
#
# This list shrinks to nothing once no live volume can still be carrying the
# entries; until then removing a name from it silently restores the double-fire.
#
# `--home` overlays the default profile in place, because that profile IS
# $TARGET_DIR and has no entry under profiles/ to name. `--cron-jobs` names the
# only id this call may force, which keeps the merge it does alongside the
# retirement a subset of 2c-bis rather than a second policy for the same file:
# two of the jobs in this roster DELETE THEMSELVES — bootstrap_delivery.py's
# _cleanup removes the scan/delivery pair once the onboarding report lands — and

# on every tick (which is also why `cp -u` never overwrites it — the PVC copy is always the
# newer one), and the bootstrap_onboarding plugin writes a chat binding into it. Overwriting
# would reset every schedule and unbind the chat; not overwriting means a job added to the
# image never appears on an existing deployment. cron_jobs_sync.py merges by job id instead,
# per key: the image wins every key it ships (the definition, including `enabled`), and every
# key it does not ship (the scheduler's own state) stays as the volume had it.
#
# The image's own copy of the script, not the volume's, for the reason step 2.5 gives for
# the scaffolder: this is a script whose whole job is to make the volume track the image, so
# reading it back off the volume is the one place a partial upgrade can hide. It also frees
# this step from depending on step 2b having worked.
#
# Writing jobs.json without a lock is safe WITHIN THIS POD, on two facts. The scheduler in
# THIS container is not running yet — everything here is ahead of `exec "$@"`. And no OTHER
# container in this pod is running this code: step 1.5 hands the shared tree to a single
# owner, so the dashboard, which has no scheduler and no reason to touch the schedule, stops
# before it gets here.
#
# Both facts stop at the pod boundary. Step 1.5 elects an owner per pod, not per volume, so
# at availability.replicas > 1 — where the operator gives the replicas ONE ReadWriteMany PVC
# rather than a volume each — every replica's gateway is an owner and several of them run
# this against the same file, with a rolling update overlapping new pods and old. The
# exposure and why it is not fixable from inside the script are set out in cron_jobs_sync.py's
# Concurrency section; the short version is that the reconcile wants to run once per volume,
# which is a topology change rather than a lock. Single-replica installs, the default, are
# unaffected. Do not restore a bare "there is no second writer" claim here: it was written
# once, it was wrong, and it read as verified.
#

# 2.6 Force-sync the image-managed persona and config files of the specialist
# profiles so they ALWAYS track the image, not the persistent PVC — the same
# guarantee step 2a gives the default profile. The scaffold in 2.5 only runs when
# a profile is ABSENT, so without this an existing platform/cluster profile on
# the PVC keeps stale personas after an image roll.
#
# The platform profile also force-syncs config.yaml, the cluster profiles do NOT,
# and that asymmetry is deliberate:
#   - The platform config.yaml is entirely image-owned — built at image build
#     time by merging the shared defaults with the platform overlay. `hermes
#     profile create` emits no config.yaml, and nothing writes to
#     profiles/platform/config.yaml at runtime — step 2.7's overlay merge is the
#     one exception, and it runs after this on purpose. Without syncing it, an
#     image that changes the platform's toolsets or plugins has no effect on any
#     existing deployment.
#
#     That last premise stops holding when HERMES_GATEWAY_PROFILE names this
#     profile. The gateway is then homed here, so this is the file `/sethome`
#     persists the home channel into and the monitoring policy mints
#     `monitoring.install_id` in — exactly the runtime state step 2d exists to
#     protect on the default profile, and a force-sync discards it on every
#     restart. So config.yaml leaves the --items list, and step 2.6b below
#     back-fills it the way step 2d back-fills the default profile's, with the
#     same fill-only rule and the same trade: keys the image ADDS still arrive,
#     keys the file already holds stay as the agent last wrote them — plus the
#     same remote MCP User-Agent repair the cluster loop runs, for the one
#     image-owned value the fill cannot reach. Everything else here force-syncs
#     either way.
#   - A cluster config.yaml is identity-stamped at scaffold time with that
#     cluster's `cluster_identity` block (project/cluster/location), so it is
#     runtime state. Overwriting it from the template would strip the record
#     cluster_agent_reconcile.py matches a profile to its cluster by, and the
#     reconciler would then scaffold a duplicate profile it can never prune.
#     (KUBECONFIG is not in this file — it is pinned in the profile's .env by
#     cluster_agent_profile.py:_pin_kubeconfig_env.) The two image-owned values
#     inside it are repaired in place instead, in the cluster loop below: the
#     retired `memory.provider` key is dropped, and the remote MCP User-Agent is
#     set to the template's, so an upgraded volume sends the same header a fresh
#     one does.
#
# Profile identity is NOT at risk either way: `hermes profile create` records the
# name and description in profiles/<name>/profile.yaml, a separate file that no
# template ships, so it is never overwritten here. Per-profile runtime state
# (USER.md, memory/, sessions/) is likewise left untouched.
#
# The sync goes through profile_scaffold.py --items rather than a `cp -f` loop
# because the list is no longer files-only: cron/, skills/, and governance/ carry
# the machinery CAPABILITIES.md advertises. `[ -f ]` is false for a directory, so
# naming them in a shell loop would be a silent no-op — an upgraded install would
# take the new CAPABILITIES.md and none of what it describes. --items copies each
# entry with copytree(dirs_exist_ok=True), which handles both. The profile already
# exists here, so the scaffold's `hermes profile create` is a no-op and only the
# overlay runs.
#
# --plugins is passed here as well as in step 2.5, for the reason this whole step
# exists: 2.5 runs on first scaffold only, so a plugin the image adds or changes
# after the PVC was created would otherwise never arrive, and a plugin copy that
# failed part-way through would stay half-copied for the volume's lifetime. The
# copy adds and overwrites without pruning, so plugin-owned runtime state on the
# volume — hermes_otel's live.db and the rest — is not in the source tree and
# survives. Targeted plugin volumes are linked in afterwards by step 2.65.
#
# cron/jobs.json is the one entry that is merged rather than replaced, inside
# profile_scaffold.py. It is image-owned and runtime state in the same file: the
# schedules, prompts and `enabled` flags ship in the image, but the scheduler
# writes each job's run history back into it and the operator can add jobs of
# its own. Copying it wholesale erased both on every pod restart, losing the
# operator's jobs and re-firing one-shots (an erased `last_run_at` is an erased
# already-ran guard) while leaving recurring jobs to skip a late run instead of
# catching it up. The merge is per key — the image wins every key it ships, the
# volume keeps every key it does not — so flipping `enabled` to false in the
# image still disables a watchdog.
#
# Known limit: the overlay adds and overwrites, it never prunes. An SOP dropped
# from the image stays on the PVC until an operator removes it by hand. That is
# the deliberate trade — this path must not start silently deleting from a user's
# volume — not an oversight.
#
# `skills/` is the one exception, and step 2.6a below is where it is made rather
# than here. Prune-never costs more there than it does for governance/: a skill
# is loaded by name from a catalogue the agent enumerates, so a retired one is
# not inert on the volume the way an unreferenced SOP is — it stays offerable,
# and a worker picks it over the procedure that replaced it. Read the two
# paragraphs together: this overlay refreshes what the image still ships, and
# 2.6a is what makes what the image dropped actually go away.
#
# hindsight/ carries the memory provider's connection config. It is image-owned
# for the same reason step 2a's copy is: a hand-edited copy left on the volume
# silently outlives the design that wrote it. The platform profile needs its own
# because a kanban worker runs with HERMES_HOME set to profiles/platform, and the
# plugin resolves $HERMES_HOME/hindsight/config.json — the default profile's copy
# is not on that path. It is named as a directory, not as hindsight/config.json:
# --items joins the name onto the profile home and copy2 needs the parent to
# exist, where a directory goes through copytree(dirs_exist_ok=True).
# Gated on profile.yaml, not on the directory: a bare mount point is not a profile, and
# dressing one in a persona and a config makes it indistinguishable from a real profile at
# the next start — which is how a half-built profile used to become permanent.
#
# `--cron-retire` finishes a retirement the two-release rule started. The first
# five ids named here shipped `enabled: false` for several releases and are now
# gone from the image's roster; none could produce a finding on a stock install
# anyway (see the retired-watchdog note in
# docs/site/src/content/docs/concepts/autonomous-watchdogs.md). Dropping the
# shipped entries alone would stop there: merge_cron_store keeps every volume
# job the image is silent about, so each PVC would carry five disabled entries
# no image could ever reach again, and `cronjob(action='list')` would go on
# showing them. Retiring the ids is what makes the deletion reach the volume.
#
# `github-issue-resolver` is here for the other reason the README gives: an id
# that has to stop firing in ONE release, not two. It was a `*/30` prompt job,
# so every tick it left behind is a full agent turn spent learning there was no
# work; `github-repo-watcher` replaces it with a `no_agent` gate that files a
# card only when the poll finds something. Leaving the old id enabled on the
# volume for a release would mean both run — the model woken 48 times a day for
# nothing, alongside the job whose entire purpose is to stop that. It is safe to
# cut in one step because nothing is lost when it stops: the replacement polls
# the same repository through the same `resolver.py poll`, three times as often.
#
# This list shrinks to nothing once no live volume can still be carrying the
# entries. Until then, removing a name from it silently strands that id.

# Whether the platform profile is the one the GATEWAY runs as, rather than one only
# kanban workers and cron jobs ever home to. The operator sets HERMES_GATEWAY_PROFILE
# from spec.harness.experimental.platformFrontDoor; two steps below turn on the answer,

# 2.6a Re-sync each specialist profile's skills from the image on every start.
# Same reasoning as 2.6, applied to the directory that carries the agent's
# executable procedures. The scaffold in 2.5 (and cluster_agent_profile.py for
# the cluster profiles) overlays skills only when the profile is ABSENT, and no
# cluster profile has skills in any force-sync list, so profiles/cluster-*/skills
# is otherwise frozen at whatever version first created the PVC — a helper script
# fixed months ago is still the broken one on every upgraded cluster.
#
# Skills are wholly image-owned (nothing writes runtime state under them; the
# cluster overlay list in cluster_agent_profile.py:OVERLAY_ITEMS treats them the
# same way), so this is a whole-directory REPLACE rather than a copy-over: a
# skill deleted from the image has to actually disappear, or a retired procedure
# stays loadable forever. That is also why this still runs for the platform
# profile even though step 2.6 just listed `skills` in its --items: the
# scaffolder overlays with copytree(dirs_exist_ok=True), which refreshes what the
# image still ships and leaves what it dropped.
#
# Building the replacement alongside and renaming keeps the window where `skills`
# does not exist to two renames, and nothing reads the profile until `exec "$@"`
# below.
#
# EVERY step is guarded, and the function never returns non-zero. It is called as
# a bare command under `set -e`, so an unguarded `mv` that fails does not degrade
# the sync — it kills the container before it ever reaches `exec "$@"`, turning a
# stale skills directory into a CrashLoopBackOff. The filesystem here is a PVC
# whose writes can fail for reasons that have nothing to do with this script
# (ENOSPC, a permission change, an `.old` left behind by a previous boot that was
# killed mid-swap), and none of them are worth refusing to start over: the
# profile keeps the skills it already had, which is exactly the state this step
# exists to improve on and not one it can make worse.
#
# The rollback matters for the same reason. Between the two renames `skills` does
# not exist, and a profile with no skills at all is worse than one with stale
# ones — `hermes` reports "Unknown skill(s)" and the worker exits 1. So a failure
# there puts the original back rather than leaving the gap.
#
# $3 is an OPTIONAL second source directory, overlaid onto the staged copy
# before the swap. It exists for the A2A skill (step 2.6a-bis's gate decides
# whether to pass it), and it goes through here rather than writing into the
# live directory afterwards for the reason the staging exists at all: a
# non-staged writer that lands in another replica's swap window recreates
# $_dst holding only ITS files, which sends the other pod down the
# "reappeared during the swap" arm below and leaves the shared profile with
# no real skills at all. Composed here, the whole tree — template plus

# 2.6a-bis The A2A topics skill, overlaid into the platform profile only when
# this install runs the next stack. The skill ships OUTSIDE the platform
# template (/opt/a2a-template, see the Dockerfile) so that 2.6a's replace
# never installs it on a today install: the mode switch's promise is that a
# normal install cannot tell the feature exists, and a skill file in the
# template would break it on day one. It rides 2.6a's staging as the overlay
# argument rather than being copied in afterwards — see the note on $3 — so
# the composed tree lands in one rename. A flip back to today self-cleans:
# the next boot stages the template alone and renames that over the profile.
#
# The gate asks runtime_mode.py, the one agent-side reader the mode spec
# allows. The mode rides the managed .env, which Hermes applies at load time
# — it is NOT in this shell's environment — so the helper hands the managed
# file to Python and lets runtime_mode read it from there.
#
# Parsed as the strict KEY=value lines renderManagedEnv writes, never sourced:
# `.` in a shell would execute anything a value with a space grew, and this
# script is pid 1.
#
# os.environ is CLEARED first, so the managed file is the only thing that can
# answer. Without that the inherited container env would be a second delivery
# path for the mode — an AgentPlugin's spec.env is copied into the container
# verbatim — and the spec's whole point is that one delivery path means one
# answer. Clearing also keeps this file from naming the key a third time,
# which is what the grep rule forbids.
#
# Exit meanings: 0 next, 1 today (or no managed scope at all — a compose or
# `docker run` start, not a fault), 2 the managed scope exists but its .env
# could not be read or the reader is missing. Only 0 overlays; 2 warns,
# because on an operator-managed install that is a real fault the skill's
# silent absence would otherwise hide. Guarded like 2.6a: nothing here ever

#
# Step 2d's problem, arriving at a second profile. Step 2.6 just left this file alone
# because the gateway now writes to it, and an untouched file tracks the image for as
# long as the volume lives: an image that adds an mcp server, a toolset or a plugin to
# agents/platform/config.yaml would reach a fresh volume and no existing one. So the
# platform profile takes the same deal the default profile takes — fill what the file
# does not say, change nothing it does. Keys the image ADDS arrive; keys the file
# already holds stay as the agent last wrote them, which is what makes `/sethome` and
# monitoring.install_id survive the restart.
#
# The operator's own settings do NOT come through here. profile-platform.overlay.yaml
# is merged by step 2.7 like every other profile's, and the managed scope pins the
# immutable leaves at load time — the same two routes the default profile takes.
#
# Runs after step 2.6, which is what leaves config.yaml alone for it to read, and
# before step 2.7, so the overlay is merged into the filled file rather than a fill
# landing on top of the overlay.
#
# PRIMARY ONLY, exactly as step 2d is: nothing here is per-container, and a second
# writer racing the first over one file on a shared PVC is what step 1.5 exists to stop.
#
# Flag off, this step does not run and step 2.6 force-syncs config.yaml as it always
# has, which subsumes any fill.
#
# Both of step 2d's arms, for the same reason it has two. Once config.yaml is off the
# force-sync, this step is the ONLY thing left that can write it: step 2.5 is gated on
# the profile being absent, step 2.6 no longer carries the name in --items, and step
# 2.7 skips a profile directory whose config.yaml is missing. So a profile registered
# without one — profile_scaffold writes profile.yaml before it copies the template, and
# the caller above swallows a failure between the two with a WARN — would stay that way
# for the life of the volume, on the profile receiving chat, with an absent
# platform_toolsets resolving to the full core bundle rather than failing closed. Flag
# off the next boot healed it; flag on nothing does. Seed from the template when the

# to reproduce), so it emits an overlay per profile and this step merges it in.

# running the old limits forever.

# 3. (removed) Enabling hermes_otel in the default profile's config.yaml.
#
# The step appended `hermes_otel` to plugins.enabled if it was missing, guarded on the file
# being writable. It had nothing to do, and for most of its life could not fire at all:
#
#   - The content was already there. `hermes_otel` heads plugins.enabled in
#     agents/chat/config.yaml, which the image installs as /opt/chat-template/config.yaml,
#     and it is in the operator's DefaultBuiltInPlugins — so both of step 2d's inputs list
#     it and the append was a no-op.
#   - The write could not land anyway while the operator subPath-mounted its rendering
#     over that path: ConfigMap volumes are mounted read-only whatever the mount's readOnly
#     field says, so `[ -w ]` was false in both the gateway and the dashboard. The mode is
#     0400/0755 on root-owned files against RunAsUser 10000 besides (the volume's
#     DefaultMode in platformagent_manifests.go), so it failed the ownership test too.
#
# Step 2d has since made that an ordinary writable file on the PVC, which only makes
# restoring this worse rather than newly safe: the guard would now pass, and the step would
# rewrite — non-atomically, over a file step 2d has just staged-and-renamed into place — a
# config it has nothing to add to. Where the guard did pass before (compose, `docker run`)
# that is exactly what it did, and yaml.safe_dump round-trips the file: it sorted the keys
# and dropped every comment in a config people read.
#
# Do not restore it as a "belt and braces" measure. If a profile ever needs a plugin the
# image does not ship enabled, the operator overlay in step 2.7 is the mechanism, and it is
# one that works on the path this ran on.

# 4. Point the hermes_otel plugin at the resolved collector and stamp the service name.
#
# Both values come from the operator's env. The endpoint matters because hermes_otel does
# NOT read OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT — its backend URL is baked into the image, so
# without this sweep a customer-configured collector would show up in the pod env and in
# .status.telemetry while every span still went to the GKE managed collector. Likewise,

# 5.5. The default kubectl context is NOT established here. There is no `gcloud`

# the sidecar's kubeconfig, not ours. The sidecar bootstraps its own context from
# CREDENTIAL_PROXY_BOOTSTRAP_COMMAND (see buildCredentialProxyEnv in the
# operator), which runs inside the workspace root before the proxy serves any
# request. The k8s-event-watcher does not need a copy either: it runs inside the
# credential-proxy container, not this one.

# 5.6. Migrate any file-based memory store into Hindsight.
#
# A volume that predates the Hindsight provider still has its memory sitting in
# Markdown. The new provider never reads those files, so without this the day the
# image rolls is the day everything the agent had learned goes dark while staying
# perfectly intact on disk — neither reachable nor gone, and nobody notices until
# a question that used to work stops working.
#
# Backgrounded, because it waits on Hindsight and on LLM extraction and must not
# hold up readiness; non-fatal, because a failed migration leaves every file
# exactly where it was and the next start tries again. The script is idempotent
# and exits immediately when there is nothing to move, which is every start after
# the one that moved it. See the script's own docstring for how deletion is gated
# on verification.
#
# Deliberately unlocked: two pods briefly sharing the volume during a rollout
# could at worst retain an entry twice, which consolidation absorbs, whereas a
# lock file outliving a SIGKILL would skip the migration permanently and
# silently.
#
# Gated on the chosen provider, because this is the one step here that is not
# reversible: it moves the Markdown into the provider and unlinks the original.
# It used to be gated on hindsight/config.json existing, but that file is
# image-owned and therefore always present, so an install that had deliberately
# kept the file-based store still had it taken away. MEMORY_PROVIDER comes from
# the operator (see buildDeployment); an empty value is a real answer — "no
# provider" — while an *unset* one means an operator too old to send it, where
# the old file-presence behaviour is the safe reading.

# 5.7. Mirror the profile layout into the shell sandbox, and move the model's
# existing files across the first time.
#
# The shell, the file tools and execute_code all run in the sandbox pod now, so
# two things that used to be true stopped being true on the day that landed.
# Paths under $TARGET_DIR/profiles/<name> no longer resolve for a file tool —
# the sandbox has the machine home and nothing below it — and everything the
# model had already written to $TARGET_DIR became invisible to it while staying
# on the volume. The script's docstring covers what crosses and what does not.
#
# Here rather than in the sandbox's own entrypoint because the profile list is
# on this pod's PVC and cluster profiles are created at runtime; the sandbox
# cannot enumerate what it has never seen. cluster_agent_profile.py calls the
# same script with --skeleton-only when it scaffolds one, so a profile created
# between restarts does not wait for the next one.
#
# Foreground, and fatal on EXIT_FATAL only. It was neither, and the reason it
# was both is sound as far as it goes: the sandbox is a separate StatefulSet
# with no start ordering against this Deployment, so "not up yet" is an ordinary
# outcome rather than an error. What that misses is that the script already
# draws the distinction. A sandbox that never answers inside --wait returns 0
# and leaves the marker unwritten, so the next start retries; the fatal exits
# are a --remote-root that is not the sandbox's volume, and a transfer that ran
# and failed. Neither is survivable and neither is transient, so backgrounding
# them bought nothing but silence: the agent came up healthy, the model's files
# were still on this volume where its shell can no longer see them, and the sole
# trace was a WARN line in a log file nobody reads. That happened on a live
# upgrade — ten cluster profile homes, every one Permission denied — and it was
# found by hand, days later.
#
# Fatal on *those* and not on everything non-zero, which is the correction. The
# layout push and the marker write both reach a filesystem uid 1000 owns, so the
# model can make either fail — and while any non-zero exit landed here, that was
# a way for a prompt injection to CrashLoopBackOff this container permanently,
# with no path back because the thing that would repair it is the thing that is
# down. Those two now return EXIT_RETRY and warn instead.
#
# Exiting non-zero here is what makes it visible, and it needs no privilege the
# agent does not have. The kubelet restarts the container, CrashLoopBackOff
# follows, and getDeploymentStatusDetails in the operator already scans the
# gateway pod's container statuses for a waiting reason and writes it into the
# CR: phase Degraded, Ready=False, and a message naming this container. The
# tail below puts the cause in `kubectl logs`, which is where the CR sends you.
#
# The cost is startup latency in the one case that blocks — a sandbox that is
# slow rather than absent — bounded by --wait at 180s. The startupProbe budget
# is agentAPIProbe(10, 60), 600s, and progressDeadlineSeconds is 1200, so the
# wait fits with room over. The copy itself runs once: it is guarded by a marker
# on the sandbox's own volume, so a fresh sandbox PVC gets a fresh copy and every
# later start skips it and re-pushes only the layout.
#
# Gated on IS_BOOTSTRAP_PRIMARY: every replica can reach the sandbox, and two
# tar streams extracting into the same directory would race. --skip-old-files
# makes that lossless rather than harmful, but there is no reason to run it
# twice.

# 6. Execute primary process from inside the agent's own directory.
#
# The image inherits WORKDIR /opt/hermes from the upstream base, which is

# path into a directory it cannot write and loses every one it can. $TARGET_DIR
# is the writable home on the PVC.
#
# This used to be a credential rule as well: every CLI in this container was a
# credential-proxy shim, the client posted `"cwd": os.getcwd()` on every
# request, and the proxy refused any cwd outside its workspace root — so a plain
# `git status` launched from /opt/hermes failed before it ran. #737 took the
# shims out of this image entirely, so what is left is the write-path reason
# above, which is enough on its own.
#
# The cwd is the only lever that reaches every caller. Hermes resolves the
# terminal and execute_code working directories from a ladder that ends at
# os.getcwd(), and for the `local` backend the CLI *overwrites* any configured
# terminal.cwd with os.getcwd() outright ("Local backend: always os.getcwd().
# Use `cd /dir && hermes` to control it."), so a config key cannot fix this —
# and kanban workers, which the dispatcher spawns as child processes, inherit
# whatever cwd the agent was started with.
#
# Guarded rather than unconditional: `set -e` would abort the container on a
# missing directory, and a shell whose cd fails silently continues in the old

# is a canary for a broken mount rather than an expected path.
