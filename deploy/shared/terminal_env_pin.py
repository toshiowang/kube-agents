"""Copy the operator's managed terminal settings into each Hermes profile's .env.

The operator pins `terminal:` in the managed config ($HERMES_MANAGED_DIR/config.yaml): the
ssh backend into the shell sandbox. Hermes applies that overlay when it loads a config, but
the per-profile terminal scope a scheduled run executes under
(tools/terminal_scope.build_profile_terminal_scope) is built from the profile's own .env
and config.yaml and never reads the managed scope. Without this, a cron job's terminal
falls back to Hermes' default `local` backend instead of the sandbox.

The scope does read TERMINAL_* from the profile .env, which is where
`hermes config set terminal.*` mirrors terminal settings, so this writes the managed values
there, then asks Hermes for the scope and fails unless it resolves to them. config.yaml is
not an option: save_config strips managed leaves from it. For the same reason, a key in the
profile's config.yaml that outranks the copy is deleted.

Only the variables the managed block maps to are replaced. Any other TERMINAL_* line is a
setting of the profile's own (`hermes config set terminal.timeout` writes one) and stays.

A failure is fatal to the caller: a profile whose scheduled runs would not use the
managed terminal is not one to start or scaffold. The start-up sweep makes one exception, below.
