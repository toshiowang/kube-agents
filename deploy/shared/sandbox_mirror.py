"""Give the shell sandbox the same directory layout as the agent pod, and move
the model's existing files across once.

Two problems, one script, because both need the same three things: the list of
Hermes profiles, the SSH key, and a connection to the sandbox. Only the agent
pod has all three.

**Layout.** The sandbox mounts its own PVC at the same absolute path as the
agent pod's Hermes home, so a SOP that says ``/opt/data/scratch/report.md``
resolves on both sides. That holds for the machine home, which the sandbox
image creates, and stops holding one level down: ``/opt/data/profiles/platform``
exists on the agent pod and the sandbox has never heard of it. A file tool
reading ``/opt/data/profiles/platform/governance/inventory_prioritize_sop.md``
runs over SSH now, and it fails there. The sandbox cannot fix this on its own —
the profile list lives on the agent pod's PVC, and cluster profiles are created
at runtime — so the agent pod pushes the skeleton in.

**Migration.** Before the shell moved, the model's work landed on the agent
pod's PVC: ``scratch`` is 91 MB of it on the install this was written against,
plus ``gitops`` clones and a scattering of directories it invented. After the
move those files are still there and the model can no longer see them, which
from a user's point of view is an upgrade that deleted their work. This copies
them over once.

Neither step is fatal. The sandbox is a separate pod with no ordering against
this one, so "not up yet" is an ordinary outcome; both steps are idempotent and
the next container start retries. That includes a copy that ran and failed: the
copy never removes anything from the agent pod, so a retry loses nothing. The
exit codes below say what is left fatal and why.

What does *not* come across, and why the list below is a denylist:

  - Hermes' own runtime state — the session and kanban databases, the caches,
    the plugin trees, the venvs. None of it is reachable from a shell and a
    second stale copy of it in a pod that cannot use it is a trap for whoever
    reads the directory next.
  - Anything holding a credential: the profile ``.env`` files, ``.ssh``,
    ``.kubeconfigs``, ``kubeconfig.yaml``. The sandbox exists so that code the
    model runs cannot reach these.
  - The trees the sandbox image already delivers — ``skills``, ``governance``,
    ``scripts``. The sandbox entrypoint replaces those from ``/opt/defaults`` on
    every start, so copying the agent pod's copies over them would be undone at
    the next restart at best and would shadow a newer image at worst.

A denylist rather than an allowlist because of which way each one fails. An
allowlist of ``scratch`` and ``gitops`` would have silently dropped ``infra``,
``infra-repo``, ``infra_repo`` and ``work-d0452361`` on the install this was
written against — model-created working directories that no instruction names,
which is exactly the "user lost their files" case. A denylist that misses
something copies a directory nobody needed, which costs disk and is visible in
the log this writes.
