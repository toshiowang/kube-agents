# Demo: Collaborative Upgrade Handshake

Implements Scenario 1 of `docs/demo.md` on the Scion-based GKE Platform Team. A `platform-coordinator` agent orchestrates an `upgrade-coordinator` and a `dev-workload-guardian` to negotiate a workload-aware upgrade plan, with human approval at each write-path boundary. `node-pool-provisioner` and `workload-deployer` are also linked into the project so the team can fan out to them as needed (e.g., scaling a workload before upgrade).

## Prerequisites

On the host (laptop):

1. **Scion CLI** installed and `scion init --machine` already run.
2. **`gcloud`** with ADC: `gcloud auth application-default login`. The active account needs `container.developer` on the in-scope cluster (plus `container.admin` if the demo will execute the upgrade).
3. **`gke-mcp`** binary on PATH (see `../../tools/README.md`).
4. **`envsubst`** (from `gettext`).
5. **Python 3** with `venv` (proxy bootstraps its own `aiohttp` deps).

## One-time host services

In separate terminals (or `tmux` panes):

```sh
# Terminal 1 — local gke-mcp HTTP server (port 9080)
../../tools/start-local-mcp.sh

# Terminal 2 — remote MCP token-refreshing proxies (8081/8082/8083)
../../tools/start-remote-mcp-proxy.sh

# Terminal 3 — Scion combo Hub + Broker + Web dashboard
scion server start --foreground --enable-hub --enable-runtime-broker --enable-web
```

## Running the demo

Set the cluster identity and scenario specifics, then bootstrap:

```sh
export GKE_PROJECT=my-sandbox-project       # GCP project ID
export GKE_LOCATION=us-central1             # region or zone
export GKE_CLUSTER=mercury-01               # cluster name
export GKE_NAMESPACES_IN_SCOPE=prod-checkout
export PROD_NAMESPACE=prod-checkout
export PRIMARY_WORKLOAD=payment-api         # the demo's "single replica" workload
export GKE_TARGET_VERSION=1.29.x            # upgrade target

./bootstrap.sh
```

`bootstrap.sh` will:
- refuse to run if a stray `.scion/` exists at the kube-agents repo root (it would shadow the demo's own `.scion/` during Scion's project resolution and templates would land in the wrong place)
- run `scion init` if needed
- stage a symlink-free copy of `templates/` into a temp dir (Scion's importer doesn't follow symlinks, and our per-template `skills/<name>` entries are symlinks into the shared `skills/` tree), then run `scion templates import --all --force <staging-dir>` to register the role templates with the local Hub
- render `MEMORY.md` and `opening-prompt.rendered.md` with your env vars filled in
- best-effort check that the host MCP services are reachable

After editing any template under `templates/`, re-run `./bootstrap.sh` to re-import (the `--force` overwrites the previously-imported copy).

Then start the coordinator:

```sh
scion start coordinator --type platform-coordinator \
  "$(cat opening-prompt.rendered.md)" --attach
```

The coordinator will read `MEMORY.md`, spawn the specialists it needs, and start the negotiation. The human (you) approves write-path actions via `ask_user` prompts that surface in the attached terminal (and in the Scion web dashboard's Inbox Tray).

To detach: `Ctrl-P Ctrl-Q`. To reattach: `scion attach coordinator`. To inspect spawned specialists: `scion list`.

## Stand-in workload

The demo expects a workload at `${PROD_NAMESPACE}/${PRIMARY_WORKLOAD}` with a single replica (so the team can detect the resilience gap). The bootstrap does **not** deploy this for you in phase 1 — either pick an existing workload in your sandbox that matches, or apply a stub:

```sh
kubectl create namespace "$PROD_NAMESPACE" --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
kubectl create deployment "$PRIMARY_WORKLOAD" \
  --image=registry.k8s.io/echoserver:1.10 \
  --namespace="$PROD_NAMESPACE" --replicas=1
```

(Eventually the bootstrap will offer to deploy a stub for you.)

## Resetting between runs

```sh
./bootstrap.sh --cleanup       # cleanup + re-bootstrap in one step
```

`--cleanup` deletes the coordinator agent (in this grove and the kube-agents grove if accidentally created there), removes `.scion/`, the rendered files, and any stray `.scion/` at the repo root, then proceeds with the normal bootstrap. If env vars are not set, `--cleanup` runs the teardown only and exits cleanly.

The coordinator's worktree state (under `~/.scion_worktrees/<project>/coordinator/`) is removed when `scion delete` runs.

## Mapping to docs/demo.md

| Demo script element | Scion implementation |
|---|---|
| `Cluster_Operator` persona | `upgrade-coordinator` template (the coordinator narrates its messages with the `Cluster_Operator` name) |
| `Dev_Team_Agent` persona | `dev-workload-guardian` template |
| Cross-agent @-mentions in shared chat | `scion message` between coordinator and specialists; the coordinator narrates the back-and-forth in the human-facing terminal |
| `MEMORY.md` constraint persistence | Same — `/workspace/MEMORY.md`, single-writer = coordinator |
| Readiness Score | Produced by `dev-workload-guardian` per its `agents.md` workflow |
| Upgrade-window negotiation | Driven by the coordinator's prose workflow; human's constraints captured in MEMORY.md |
| Human approval gates | `sciontool status ask_user` from the responsible specialist; coordinator surfaces |
