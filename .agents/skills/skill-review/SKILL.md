# Task

Review agent skill definitions (`SKILL.md` files) to enforce maximum token efficiency, eliminate conversational fluff, and ensure standardized formatting without losing functional fidelity.

# Checks

## 1. Structure & Headers

- **Standardization**: Require a top-level `# Task` section and `# Checks` (or `# Workflow`) section.
- **Header Conciseness**: Flag overly verbose headers (e.g., `## Focus Areas & Deterministic Checks`). Require terse headers.

## 2. Prose & Verbosity

- **Persona Elimination**: Flag conversational AI persona setups (e.g., "You are an expert..."). Replace with imperative tasks.
- **Conversational Fluff**: Flag transitional phrases, unnecessary adverbs, and filler words.
- **Imperative Voice**: Require bullet points to start with strong, punchy verbs (`Flag...`, `Require...`, `Ensure...`).

## 3. Formatting

- **Density**: Ensure rules are condensed into terse, single-sentence commands where possible.
- **Fidelity**: Ensure no deterministic rules, checks, or domain knowledge are lost during token optimization.
