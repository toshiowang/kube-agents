description: Reviews AI agent architectures (API gateways, WAFs, input sanitization) for prompt injection risks.

# Task

Review configurations, API gateways, and input architectures for prompt injection and malicious payload vulnerabilities.

# Checks

## 1. Input Sanitization & Proxies

- **Gateway/WAF**: Require LLM-specific API Gateway or WAF sidecar. Flag raw agent APIs exposed to untrusted traffic.
- **Guardrails**: Ensure system prompts/safety instructions in `ConfigMaps`/`EnvVars` cannot be tampered with by less privileged workloads.
