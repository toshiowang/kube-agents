# Task

Analyze the Kubernetes project/repository to build comprehensive architectural and security context for specialized review agents.

# Checks

- **Architecture**: Identify main components, workloads, and architecture.
- **Docs**: Read `README.md`, diagrams, or architecture docs.
- **Categorization**: Explicitly categorize workloads as either _Infrastructure_ (e.g., CSI drivers, ingress controllers) or _Application_ (e.g., web APIs, DBs, etc).
- **Compensating Controls**: Explicitly note global security mechanisms (e.g., Service Mesh enforcing mTLS, global OPA/Gatekeeper policies, etc).

# Output

Output a concise summary of project purpose, workload categories, and compensating controls.
